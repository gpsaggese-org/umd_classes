### Project 1: Text Classification with Transformers
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: 
The goal is to classify movie reviews from the IMDb dataset into positive or negative sentiments using a transformer model built with Xformers.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset: Available on Kaggle [IMDb Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-movie-reviews).

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Load and clean the dataset, removing any unnecessary characters and formatting text for tokenization.
- Model Building:
    - Construct a simple transformer model using Xformers for binary classification.
- Training:
    - Train the model on the processed movie reviews, adjusting hyperparameters to optimize performance.
- Evaluation:
    - Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
- Visualization:
    - Visualize the training process with loss curves and confusion matrices using Matplotlib.

### Project 2: Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Transformers
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)

**Project Objective**: 
Develop a named entity recognition system that identifies and classifies entities in text (e.g., persons, organizations, locations) using the CoNLL-2003 dataset and Xformers.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition Dataset: Available on Hugging Face Datasets [CoNLL-2003](https://huggingface.co/datasets/conll2003).

**Tasks**:
- Data Preparation:
    - Load the CoNLL-2003 dataset and preprocess the text and labels for training.
- Model Construction:
    - Build a transformer architecture using Xformers, specifically tailored for sequence labeling tasks.
- Fine-tuning:
    - Fine-tune the model on the NER dataset, experimenting with different learning rates and batch sizes.
- Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the model using F1-score and classification reports to measure entity recognition accuracy.
- Model Analysis:
    - Analyze common misclassifications and visualize the results with examples.

**Bonus Ideas**:
- Experiment with different transformer architectures (e.g., BERT, GPT) and compare their performance on the NER task.

### Project 3: Time-Series Forecasting with Transformers
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: 
Implement a time-series forecasting model to predict future stock prices using historical data and a transformer architecture built with Xformers.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Yahoo Finance Stock Prices: Use the Yahoo Finance API to retrieve historical stock price data for a chosen company (e.g., Apple Inc. - AAPL).

**Tasks**:
- Data Acquisition:
    - Fetch historical stock price data using the Yahoo Finance API and preprocess the data for modeling.
- Feature Engineering:
    - Create relevant features such as moving averages, volatility, and other technical indicators.
- Model Design:
    - Construct a transformer model using Xformers capable of handling time-series data.
- Training and Validation:
    - Train the model on the prepared dataset, implementing techniques like early stopping and cross-validation to prevent overfitting.
- Forecasting:
    - Generate future stock price predictions and evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Visualization:
    - Visualize actual vs. predicted stock prices over time using Seaborn or Matplotlib.

**Bonus Ideas**:
- Explore multi-step forecasting, where the model predicts multiple future time steps, and compare performance against traditional time-series models like ARIMA.
