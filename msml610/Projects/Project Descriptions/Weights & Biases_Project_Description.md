**Description**

Weights & Biases (W&B) is a powerful tool designed for tracking machine learning experiments, visualizing results, and collaborating with teams. It provides functionalities like experiment tracking, hyperparameter tuning, and dataset versioning, making it easier for data scientists to manage their workflows efficiently.

**Project 1: Predicting Housing Prices**  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: The goal is to build a regression model that predicts housing prices based on various features such as location, size, and number of bedrooms. The project aims to optimize the model's performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "California Housing Prices" dataset available on Kaggle. Link: [California Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

**Tasks**:
- **Set Up W&B**: Initialize a W&B project and configure the experiment tracking.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Load the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature scaling.
- **Model Development**: Choose a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) and train it on the dataset.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use W&B's hyperparameter optimization features to find the best model parameters.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model performance using metrics like RMSE and visualize results in W&B dashboards.

**Bonus Ideas**: Experiment with different regression algorithms and compare their performances using W&B's visualization tools.

**Project 2: Image Classification with Transfer Learning**  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: The objective is to classify images of animals using pre-trained models and fine-tune them to optimize accuracy. This project will involve transferring knowledge from a pre-trained model to a specific dataset.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Animal Faces" dataset available on Kaggle. Link: [Animal Faces](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/animal-faces)

**Tasks**:
- **Set Up W&B**: Create a new W&B project to track experiments and metrics.
- **Data Preparation**: Load the dataset, perform data augmentation, and split data into training and validation sets.
- **Model Selection**: Choose a pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet50) for transfer learning.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the model on the animal faces dataset and track training metrics with W&B.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's accuracy and loss, and visualize the training process using W&B's plots.

**Bonus Ideas**: Implement model ensembling techniques and compare their performance using W&B.

**Project 3: Time Series Forecasting for Stock Prices**  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: The goal is to develop a time series forecasting model to predict stock prices based on historical data. This project aims to optimize forecasting accuracy and analyze the impact of various features.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Stock Prices" dataset from Yahoo Finance via the yfinance library. You can track historical stock prices for any company (e.g., Apple Inc. - AAPL).

**Tasks**:
- **Set Up W&B**: Initialize a W&B project for tracking experiments and results.
- **Data Collection**: Use the yfinance library to fetch historical stock prices and preprocess the data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create additional features like moving averages and momentum indicators to enhance the model.
- **Model Development**: Implement a time series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM or ARIMA) and track training metrics using W&B.
- **Performance Analysis**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like MAE and visualize predictions against actual prices in W&B.

**Bonus Ideas**: Experiment with different forecasting techniques (e.g., Prophet, SARIMA) and compare their results using W&B visualizations.
