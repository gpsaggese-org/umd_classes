**Description**

Koalas is a Python library that provides a pandas-like API on top of Apache Spark, enabling users to leverage the power of distributed computing while maintaining the familiar syntax of pandas. This tool is particularly useful for handling large datasets that exceed the memory limits of a single machine. 

Features of Koalas include:
- A seamless transition from pandas to Spark, allowing for easy scaling of data processing tasks.
- Support for a wide range of pandas operations, making it user-friendly for those familiar with pandas.
- Enhanced performance for large datasets through distributed computing capabilities.

### Project 1: Customer Segmentation with E-commerce Data

**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: The goal is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior to optimize marketing strategies. This will involve clustering techniques to identify distinct customer groups.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Online Retail" dataset available on Kaggle, which contains transactional data from a UK-based online retailer.

**Tasks**:
- Load and Preprocess Data:
    - Use Koalas to read the dataset and handle missing values.
  
- Feature Engineering:
    - Create features like total purchase amount, frequency of purchases, and recency of last purchase.

- Clustering:
    - Implement K-means clustering to segment customers based on engineered features.

- Evaluation:
    - Analyze cluster characteristics and visualize the results using Koalasâ€™ plotting capabilities.

- Reporting:
    - Summarize insights and suggest tailored marketing strategies for each customer segment.

### Project 2: Predictive Maintenance in Manufacturing

**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: The aim is to predict equipment failures in a manufacturing setting using time-series sensor data, thereby reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set" available on Kaggle, which contains sensor readings from aircraft engines.

**Tasks**:
- Data Ingestion:
    - Load the dataset using Koalas and explore the structure of the time-series data.

- Data Cleaning:
    - Handle missing values and outliers, ensuring the data is clean for analysis.

- Feature Extraction:
    - Extract relevant features from the time-series data, such as moving averages and trends.

- Model Development:
    - Train a regression model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict the time to failure based on the extracted features.

- Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and visualize the predictions against actual failure times.

### Project 3: Sentiment Analysis on Social Media for Brand Monitoring

**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: The goal is to perform sentiment analysis on social media posts related to a specific brand to gauge public perception and identify potential issues.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Twitter US Airline Sentiment" dataset available on Kaggle, which contains tweets about airlines and their sentiment labels.

**Tasks**:
- Data Acquisition:
    - Load the dataset using Koalas and preprocess the text data for analysis.

- Text Preprocessing:
    - Clean the text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and applying stemming/lemmatization.

- Sentiment Analysis:
    - Implement a pre-trained NLP model (e.g., BERT) to classify the sentiment of tweets.

- Data Aggregation:
    - Use Koalas to aggregate sentiment scores by time periods (daily/weekly) to identify trends.

- Visualization and Reporting:
    - Visualize the sentiment trends over time and correlate them with events (e.g., service disruptions or promotions).

- Insights and Recommendations:
    - Provide insights on how public sentiment impacts brand reputation and suggest strategies for improvement.

**Bonus Ideas**: 
- For Project 1, consider comparing different clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering).
- For Project 2, explore the impact of seasonal trends on failure predictions and incorporate additional external factors such as maintenance logs.
- For Project 3, extend the analysis by integrating external datasets (e.g., news articles) to see how they affect sentiment.
