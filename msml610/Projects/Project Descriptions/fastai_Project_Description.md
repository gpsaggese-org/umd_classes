**Description**

Fastai is a high-level Python library built on top of PyTorch, designed to simplify training deep learning models while providing powerful abstractions. It focuses on making deep learning accessible and efficient, featuring:

- **Layered API**: Simplifies complex deep learning tasks with a user-friendly interface.
- **Transfer Learning**: Facilitates quick model training using pre-trained models for various tasks.
- **Data Augmentation**: Provides built-in techniques to enhance training datasets, improving model robustness.
- **Integrated Learner**: Combines data, model, and training methods into a single object for streamlined experimentation.

### Project 1: Image Classification of Plant Species (Difficulty: 1)

**Project Objective**: Build a model that classifies images of different plant species using Fastai, optimizing for accuracy in prediction.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Plant Seedlings Classification" dataset available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification/data).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preparation**: Load the dataset and preprocess the images for training.
- **Model Training**: Utilize Fastai’s transfer learning capabilities to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the seedling images.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy metrics and confusion matrix.
- **Visualization**: Plot training and validation losses and accuracies to analyze model performance.
- **Deployment**: Create a simple web app using Streamlit to allow users to upload images and receive predictions.

### Project 2: Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews (Difficulty: 2)

**Project Objective**: Develop a sentiment analysis model that classifies movie reviews as positive or negative, optimizing for F1-score.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "IMDb Movie Reviews" dataset from Hugging Face Datasets (https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Ingestion**: Load the dataset and preprocess text data (tokenization, cleaning).
- **Data Augmentation**: Implement techniques to balance the dataset if necessary.
- **Model Training**: Use Fastai’s NLP capabilities to create a text classifier based on pre-trained language models.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different learning rates and batch sizes to optimize the model.
- **Evaluation**: Use precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualization**: Create word clouds for positive and negative reviews to visualize sentiment.

### Project 3: Time Series Forecasting of Stock Prices (Difficulty: 3)

**Project Objective**: Create a forecasting model to predict future stock prices based on historical data, optimizing for mean absolute error (MAE).

**Dataset Suggestions**: Utilize the "S&P 500 Stock Prices" dataset available on Yahoo Finance (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC) and download historical daily prices.

**Tasks**:
- **Data Collection**: Fetch historical stock price data using the Yahoo Finance API.
- **Data Preparation**: Preprocess the data for time series analysis (handling missing values, scaling).
- **Model Training**: Implement Fastai's time series capabilities to build a forecasting model (e.g., LSTM).
- **Feature Engineering**: Create additional features such as moving averages and lagged variables to improve predictions.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the model's forecasting accuracy using MAE and visualize predictions against actual stock prices.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Experiment with ensemble methods or hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: 
- For Project 1, explore using Grad-CAM to visualize which parts of the image influenced the model's decision.
- For Project 2, consider implementing a multi-class classification for different sentiment categories (e.g., positive, neutral, negative).
- For Project 3, integrate external data sources (e.g., news sentiment analysis) to enhance forecasting accuracy.
