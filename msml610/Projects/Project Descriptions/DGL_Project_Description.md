**Description**

DGL (Deep Graph Library) is a Python library designed for deep learning on graphs. It provides a flexible framework that allows users to build and train graph neural networks (GNNs) efficiently. DGL supports various graph structures and enables seamless integration with popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.

Technologies Used
DGL

- Supports various graph types including undirected, directed, and heterogenous graphs.
- Facilitates the implementation of state-of-the-art GNN architectures.
- Provides efficient data handling and batching for large-scale graphs.

**Project 1: Social Network Analysis for Community Detection**  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: The goal is to identify and visualize communities within a social network using graph clustering techniques, optimizing for modularity.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Facebook Social Network" dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhendra/facebook-social-network).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Load the Facebook social network dataset and create a graph representation using DGL.
- **Graph Construction**: Construct the graph with nodes representing users and edges representing friendships.
- **Community Detection**: Implement a GNN model (e.g., GraphSAGE) to detect communities within the network.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the quality of detected communities using metrics like modularity and silhouette score.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the community structure using libraries like NetworkX or Matplotlib.

**Bonus Ideas**: Experiment with different GNN architectures for community detection or apply the model to different social networks.

**Project 2: Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions**  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: Build a GNN model that predicts fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset, optimizing for detection accuracy.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dalpozz/creditcard-fraud).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preparation**: Load the dataset and create a transaction graph where nodes represent transactions and edges represent user connections.
- **Feature Engineering**: Generate features based on transaction patterns and user behavior.
- **Model Development**: Implement a GNN model (e.g., GAT) to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Train the model and evaluate performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Anomaly Analysis**: Analyze misclassified transactions to identify patterns of fraud.

**Bonus Ideas**: Compare the GNN model's performance with traditional machine learning models like Random Forest or SVM.

**Project 3: Recommendation System for Movie Recommendations**  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: Develop a GNN-based recommendation system that predicts user preferences for movies based on their viewing history, optimizing for user satisfaction.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "MovieLens 20M" dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preparation**: Load the MovieLens dataset and create a bipartite graph with users and movies as nodes, and edges representing user ratings.
- **Graph Representation**: Implement techniques to represent user-movie interactions effectively within the graph structure.
- **Model Training**: Build and train a GNN model (e.g., Graph Convolutional Network) to predict user ratings for unrated movies.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using metrics such as RMSE and MAE to assess prediction accuracy.
- **Recommendation Generation**: Generate and recommend top-N movies for users based on predicted ratings.

**Bonus Ideas**: Explore the impact of incorporating additional features (like genre or director) into the GNN model, or implement a hybrid recommendation approach combining GNN with collaborative filtering techniques.
