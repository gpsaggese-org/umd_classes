**Description**

Gensim is a robust Python library designed for topic modeling and document similarity analysis using unsupervised learning. It excels in handling large text corpora and provides efficient algorithms for word embeddings, such as Word2Vec and FastText. Gensim allows for easy implementation of various NLP tasks, including document similarity, topic extraction, and text classification.

**Project 1: Text Classification of Movie Reviews**  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: The goal is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using a dataset of labeled reviews, optimizing for accuracy in classification.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset: Available on Kaggle ([IMDB Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)).

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Clean and tokenize the text data, removing stop words and punctuation.
- Word Embedding using Gensim:
    - Train a Word2Vec model on the preprocessed reviews to create word embeddings.
- Feature Extraction:
    - Convert the movie reviews into vectors using the trained Word2Vec model.
- Model Training:
    - Train a simple classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression) using the extracted features.
- Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Experiment with different classification algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest).
- Implement a confusion matrix to visualize classification results.

**Project 2: Topic Modeling on News Articles**  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: The aim is to identify and visualize the main topics discussed in a collection of news articles, optimizing for the coherence of the topics extracted.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- 20 Newsgroups Dataset: Available via the Scikit-learn library or on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/20-newsgroups).

**Tasks**:
- Data Collection:
    - Load the 20 Newsgroups dataset and preprocess the text (tokenization, lowercasing).
- Topic Modeling with Gensim:
    - Implement Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using Gensim to extract topics from the news articles.
- Coherence Score Evaluation:
    - Calculate the coherence score for different numbers of topics to find the optimal number.
- Visualization:
    - Use pyLDAvis to visualize the topics and their relationships.
- Interpretation:
    - Analyze the top keywords for each topic and summarize the findings.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Compare LDA with Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for topic extraction.
- Extend the analysis to temporal trends of topics over time.

**Project 3: Document Similarity in Research Papers**  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: The project aims to build a system that identifies similar research papers based on their abstracts, optimizing for precision in similarity ranking.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- arXiv Dataset: Use the arXiv API to collect research paper abstracts from various domains (e.g., [arXiv API](https://arxiv.org/help/api/index)).

**Tasks**:
- Data Collection:
    - Use the arXiv API to fetch abstracts of research papers in a specific domain (e.g., Machine Learning).
- Text Preprocessing:
    - Clean the abstracts by removing special characters and stop words, and tokenize the text.
- Word Embedding with Gensim:
    - Train a FastText model on the abstracts to generate word embeddings.
- Document Vector Creation:
    - Create document vectors by averaging the word embeddings of the words in each abstract.
- Similarity Calculation:
    - Implement cosine similarity to compare document vectors and rank the most similar papers.
- Evaluation:
    - Validate the results by manually checking the top similar papers for relevance.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Implement a clustering algorithm to group similar papers together.
- Extend the similarity search to include full-text comparisons instead of just abstracts.
