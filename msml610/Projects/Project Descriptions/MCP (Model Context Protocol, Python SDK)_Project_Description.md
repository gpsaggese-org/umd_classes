**Description**

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a Python SDK designed to facilitate the integration and management of machine learning models in various contexts. It enables data scientists to streamline model deployment and monitoring while ensuring that models are used in the appropriate scenarios. The tool provides features for versioning, context management, and seamless integration with other data science tools.

**Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction**  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: The goal is to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service by analyzing historical customer data. The project aims to identify customers at risk of leaving and optimize retention strategies.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Dataset: "Telco Customer Churn" available on Kaggle.  
- Link: [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

**Tasks**:  
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
  
- Feature Engineering:
    - Create relevant features that might influence customer churn, such as tenure, monthly charges, and service usage.

- Model Training:
    - Utilize MCP to manage the model context while training a logistic regression model for churn prediction.

- Model Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- Context Management:
    - Implement MCP to version the model and track its performance over time.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Compare different models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) and their performance against the logistic regression model.  
- Implement a simple dashboard to visualize churn rates and model predictions.

**Project 2: Real Estate Price Prediction**  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: The aim is to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. The project seeks to optimize the pricing strategy for real estate listings.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Dataset: "House Sales in King County, USA" available on Kaggle.  
- Link: [House Sales in King County, USA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)

**Tasks**:  
- Data Exploration:
    - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between features and house prices.

- Feature Engineering:
    - Create new features and transform existing ones (e.g., log transformation of prices, one-hot encoding of categorical variables).

- Model Training:
    - Use MCP to manage the context while training a regression model (e.g., XGBoost) for price prediction.

- Hyperparameter Tuning:
    - Optimize model performance using techniques such as grid search or random search, managed through MCP.

- Model Monitoring:
    - Set up monitoring to track model performance over time, ensuring it remains accurate as new data comes in.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Experiment with ensemble methods to improve prediction accuracy.  
- Implement a web application to allow users to input property details and receive price predictions.

**Project 3: Fake News Detection**  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: The project aims to build a robust model to detect fake news articles based on textual features and metadata. The objective is to optimize the model's ability to accurately classify news articles as real or fake.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Dataset: "Fake News Detection" from Kaggle.  
- Link: [Fake News Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data)

**Tasks**:  
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Clean and preprocess the text data, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.

- Feature Extraction:
    - Utilize techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings to convert text data into numerical features.

- Model Selection:
    - Use MCP to manage the context while training various models (e.g., BERT, LSTM) for classification.

- Model Evaluation:
    - Implement cross-validation and evaluate model performance using metrics such as ROC-AUC, precision, and recall.

- Contextual Deployment:
    - Utilize MCP to deploy the model in a context-aware manner, ensuring it can adapt to different news categories or sources.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Explore adversarial training techniques to improve model robustness against deceptive articles.  
- Create a user interface that allows users to input articles and receive real-time classification results.
