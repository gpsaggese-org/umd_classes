**Description**

In this project, students will leverage Gymnasium, a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms, to create and evaluate agents in various simulated environments. Gymnasium provides a wide range of environments for training AI agents, allowing them to learn through trial and error. This tool is essential for exploring concepts in reinforcement learning, including policy optimization, reward structures, and agent behavior.

Technologies Used
Gymnasium

- Offers a diverse set of environments for reinforcement learning, including classic control tasks, Atari games, and robotic simulations.
- Supports custom environment creation to tailor challenges for specific learning objectives.
- Facilitates easy integration with popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

**Project 1: Basic CartPole Balancing**  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: Create a reinforcement learning agent that learns to balance a pole on a cart by optimizing its actions to maintain the pole's upright position for as long as possible.

**Dataset Suggestions**: No external datasets are needed; the CartPole environment is included in Gymnasium.

**Tasks**:
- Set Up the CartPole Environment:
  - Initialize the CartPole environment using Gymnasium.
  - Understand the state and action spaces.
