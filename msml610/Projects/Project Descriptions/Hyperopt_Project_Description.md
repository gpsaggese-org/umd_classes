**Description**

Hyperopt is a powerful Python library for hyperparameter optimization that allows users to automatically search for the best parameters for machine learning models. It employs various optimization algorithms, including random search, Tree of Parzen Estimators (TPE), and adaptive TPE, to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space. 

**Technologies Used**  
Hyperopt  
- Facilitates hyperparameter tuning through efficient search algorithms.  
- Supports strategies such as random search, TPE, and adaptive TPE.  
- Easily integrates with libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, and XGBoost.

### Project 1: Predicting Life Expectancy  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  

**Project Objective**  
Build a regression model to predict a country’s average life expectancy based on health, economic, and demographic factors. Optimize hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.  

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- **Dataset**: [Life Expectancy (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)  
- **Domain**: Healthcare, regression.  

**Tasks**  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables (e.g., country, status).  
- **Model Selection**: Train models using:  
  - `LinearRegression` (scikit-learn) as a baseline.  
  - `RandomForestRegressor` (scikit-learn).  
  - `XGBoostRegressor` (XGBoost).  
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Use Hyperopt to tune parameters such as number of estimators, learning rate, and max depth.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models with RMSE and R².  
- **Visualization**: Plot predicted vs. actual life expectancy values.  

**Bonus Ideas**: Compare feature importance to identify the strongest predictors of life expectancy.

**Tasks**  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Resize and normalize images, split into training and validation sets.  
- **Model Selection**: Train models using:  
  - A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow/Keras.  
  - A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a baseline.  
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Use Hyperopt to tune CNN parameters such as filters, kernel size, dropout rate, learning rate, and batch size.  
- **Model Training**: Train models with optimized hyperparameters.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Compare CNN and MLP results using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- **Visualization**: Plot training curves and show examples of correctly and incorrectly classified images.  

**Bonus Ideas**: Apply transfer learning with pretrained models like ResNet50 and fine-tune with Hyperopt.
