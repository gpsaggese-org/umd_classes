**Description**

EconML is a Python library designed for estimating causal effects in economic and social science contexts using machine learning methods. It provides tools for treatment effect estimation and policy evaluation, leveraging machine learning models to uncover heterogeneous treatment effects. Key features include:

- **Causal Inference**: Implements advanced techniques for estimating treatment effects.  
- **Flexible Models**: Supports a variety of base learners (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE).  
- **Integration with Scikit-learn**: Seamlessly integrates with Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation.  
- **Robustness**: Offers methods to control for confounding variables and improve the reliability of causal estimates.

### Project 1: Evaluating the Impact of Marketing Campaigns on Sales  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy) 

**Project Objective**  
Estimate the causal effect of a marketing campaign on sales for a retail company, identifying whether the campaign significantly boosted sales.  

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- [Online Retail Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayuv/onlineretail) on Kaggle, which contains transactions from a UK-based online retailer.  

**Tasks**  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset, focusing on transaction dates, product categories, and sales amounts.  
- **Define Treatment Groups**: Simulate campaign periods (e.g., treat specific months as “campaign active”) to create treated vs. control groups.  
- **ATE Estimation**: Use EconML to estimate the average treatment effect of the campaign on sales.  
- **Model Experimentation**: Compare results across at least two base learners (e.g., Linear Regression vs. Random Forest).  
- **Interpret Results**: Visualize the treatment effects and highlight customer/product groups that benefited most.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Evaluate multiple campaign types (e.g., holiday promotions vs. regular discounts).

### Project 2: Analyzing the Effects of Education Programs on Student Performance  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium) 

**Project Objective**  
Evaluate the impact of educational programs on student performance, identifying which student demographics benefit most.  

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- [OECD PISA Dataset](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/) (Programme for International Student Assessment), which provides large-scale international student performance data with demographics and education variables.  

**Tasks**  
- **EDA**: Explore student demographics (e.g., socioeconomic background, gender) and performance scores (math, reading, science).  
- **Define Treatment Groups**: Define “treatment” as participation in extra educational resources/programs available in the dataset (e.g., tutoring, study support).  
- **CATE Estimation**: Use EconML to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects across demographics.  
- **Model Experimentation**: Compare multiple base learners (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Lasso) for treatment effect estimation.  
- **Interpretation**: Identify which student subgroups show the greatest benefit.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Perform cross-validation to assess robustness of estimates.  
- Compare results across multiple PISA countries to study policy differences.

### Project 3: Evaluating the Impact of Health Interventions on Patient Outcomes  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard) 

**Project Objective**  
Assess the causal effects of a health intervention on patient outcomes, focusing on treatment heterogeneity across different health conditions.  

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- [NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/) from the CDC, which provides detailed health and nutrition data.  

**Tasks**  
- **Data Preparation**: Clean NHANES data, select relevant health metrics (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol).  
- **Define Treatment Groups**: Define interventions (e.g., exercise programs, dietary changes, or medication use) vs. control.  
- **CATE Estimation**: Use EconML to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects across patient demographics and health conditions.  
- **Model Experimentation**: Compare multiple base learners (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Neural Nets) for causal effect estimation.  
- **Robustness Checks**: Control for confounders and assess how sensitive estimates are to model assumptions.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Compare EconML’s treatment effect estimates with traditional regression-based methods.  
- Analyze policy implications (e.g., which patient subgroups should interventions prioritize).
