**Description**

YData Profiling is a Python library that generates profile reports from a pandas DataFrame, providing a comprehensive overview of the dataset's structure, including data types, missing values, statistical summaries, and visualizations. It helps data scientists quickly understand the characteristics of their data, making it easier to identify issues and inform subsequent analysis.

Features:

- Generates detailed reports that summarize data distributions, correlations, and missing values.
- Offers visualizations for better understanding of data characteristics.
- Supports integration with Jupyter notebooks for interactive data exploration.

### Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Survival Data (Difficulty: 1)

**Project Objective**  
The goal of this project is to explore the Titanic dataset to understand the factors affecting passenger survival rates. Students will optimize their understanding of the data and identify key features that correlate with survival.

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- Titanic dataset available on Kaggle: [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

**Tasks**  
- Load and Prepare Data:
  - Import the Titanic dataset and clean any inconsistencies.
  
- Generate Profile Report:
  - Use YData Profiling to generate a comprehensive report of the dataset.
  
- Analyze Missing Values:
  - Identify and visualize missing data patterns to understand their impact on analysis.
  
- Feature Correlation:
  - Explore correlations between features and survival rates using the profile report.
  
- Summary Statistics:
  - Extract key statistical insights from the report to present findings.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Compare survival rates across different passenger classes and genders using visualizations.
- Predict survival using a simple classification model (e.g., logistic regression) based on key features identified in the analysis.

### Project 3: Analyzing Air Quality Data for Urban Planning (Difficulty: 3)

**Project Objective**  
The objective of this project is to analyze air quality data from multiple urban locations to identify pollution patterns and their correlation with health outcomes. Students will aim to provide insights that could inform urban planning decisions.

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- Air quality dataset available on Kaggle: [Air Quality Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/air-quality-data-set)

**Tasks**  
- Data Collection and Preparation:
  - Import the air quality dataset and perform initial cleaning and preprocessing to handle noise and missing values.
  
- Generate Profile Report:
  - Utilize YData Profiling to create a detailed report that summarizes air quality metrics and trends.
  
- Temporal Analysis:
  - Analyze how air quality changes over time and correlate with health data (if available) to detect trends.
  
- Advanced Feature Engineering:
  - Develop features that capture seasonal variations and extreme pollution events.
  
- Predictive Modeling:
  - Implement regression models to predict health outcomes based on air quality metrics and evaluate model performance.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Explore the impact of specific pollutants on health outcomes using statistical tests.
- Create a dashboard that visualizes air quality trends and predictions for urban planners.
