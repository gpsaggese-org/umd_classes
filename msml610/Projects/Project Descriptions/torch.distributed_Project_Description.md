**Description**

Torch.distributed is a package in PyTorch that enables distributed training of deep learning models across multiple devices and nodes. It allows for efficient parallel processing, which is essential for scaling up machine learning tasks and handling large datasets. Key features include:

- **Data Parallelism**: Distributes the training of models across multiple GPUs or nodes to speed up the training process.
- **Collective Communication**: Implements various communication patterns like broadcast, gather, and scatter to facilitate data sharing among processes.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Supports robust training sessions that can recover from failures, ensuring uninterrupted model training.
