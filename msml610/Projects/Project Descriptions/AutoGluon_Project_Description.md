### Project 1: Predicting Airbnb Nightly Prices  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  

**Project Objective**:  
Predict Airbnb listing prices based on features such as location, number of rooms, and amenities. The goal is to optimize prediction accuracy and minimize mean absolute error (MAE) using AutoGluon.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: New York City Airbnb Open Data  
- **Link**: [NYC Airbnb Open Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Loading**: Import the Airbnb dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.  
- **Model Training**: Use AutoGluon to train multiple regression models automatically.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using MAE and RMSE.  
- **Feature Importance**: Analyze the most influential features for pricing.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Compare AutoGluon predictions with a baseline Linear Regression model.  
- Visualize price trends by location, property type, and amenities.

### Project 2: Employee Attrition Prediction  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  

**Project Objective**:  
Predict whether employees are likely to leave a company based on demographic, job satisfaction, and performance features. The focus is on improving recall to correctly identify at-risk employees.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset  
- **Link**: [Employee Attrition (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Loading**: Import the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize numeric variables.  
- **Model Training**: Use AutoGluon to automatically train classification models.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate using accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
- **Model Interpretation**: Apply SHAP or LIME to understand which features contribute most to attrition.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Create cost-sensitive models to reflect the high business cost of false negatives (missing an at-risk employee).  
- Build a dashboard to visualize employee attrition risks by department and job role.

### Project 3: Image Classification of Natural Scenes  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  

**Project Objective**:  
Classify images of natural scenes into categories such as buildings, forests, mountains, and glaciers. The aim is to optimize classification accuracy and experiment with AutoGluon’s image classification capabilities.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: Intel Image Classification Dataset  
- **Link**: [Intel Image Classification (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Loading**: Import and preprocess images using AutoGluon’s image handling API.  
- **Data Augmentation**: Apply transformations such as rotations, flips, and color adjustments to improve generalization.  
- **Model Training**: Use AutoGluon to train CNN-based image classifiers and perform hyperparameter tuning.  
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.  
- **Visualization**: Display sample predictions and highlight misclassified images.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Compare AutoGluon’s results with a pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet).  
- Build a simple web app that takes an image upload and returns the predicted class.
