**Description**

LakeFS is an open-source data versioning tool designed for managing data lakes. It allows users to create, manage, and collaborate on datasets in a versioned manner, similar to Git for code. LakeFS enhances data workflows by providing features like branching, committing, and data lineage tracking, making it easier to experiment with data and maintain reproducibility in data science projects.

### Project 1: Data Versioning for Customer Segmentation
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: The goal is to implement a customer segmentation model using a retail dataset, leveraging LakeFS for data versioning to track changes and improvements in the model over time.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Online Retail Dataset" available on Kaggle ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mashlyn/online-retail)).

**Tasks**:
- **Set Up LakeFS**: Install and configure LakeFS to create a versioned repository for the dataset.
- **Data Ingestion**: Load the Online Retail dataset into LakeFS and create initial branches for exploration.
- **Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables) and version the cleaned dataset.
- **Segmentation Model**: Implement a K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on purchasing behavior.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate clustering results using silhouette score and visualize clusters with Matplotlib.
- **Version Control**: Document changes in the data and model iterations using LakeFS commits.

### Project 2: Time-Series Forecasting with Data Versioning
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)

**Project Objective**: The aim is to develop a time-series forecasting model for predicting airline passenger numbers, utilizing LakeFS to manage different versions of the dataset and model experiments.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "International Airline Passengers" dataset from Kaggle ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakannimer/air-passengers)).

**Tasks**:
- **LakeFS Setup**: Create a LakeFS repository for versioning the AirPassengers dataset.
- **Data Exploration**: Analyze seasonality and trends in passenger numbers.
- **Preprocessing**: Perform date parsing, resampling, and version the processed dataset.
- **Model Development**: Implement an ARIMA or Prophet model to forecast future passenger numbers.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and visualize predictions against actual values.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Use LakeFS branching to test different model parameters and track results.


### Project 3: Anomaly Detection in Financial Transactions
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: The project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in a financial dataset using machine learning, employing LakeFS for version control of both the data and the model's training process.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset available on Kaggle ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dalpozz/creditcard-fraud)).

**Tasks**:
- **Initialize LakeFS**: Set up a LakeFS repository to manage versions of the credit card transaction dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle class imbalance and preprocess features using techniques like SMOTE and normalization, versioning each step.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create additional features to improve model performance and track these changes with LakeFS.
- **Model Implementation**: Build a Random Forest classifier to identify fraudulent transactions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score, visualizing results with confusion matrices.
- **Versioning Experiments**: Create branches in LakeFS to test different algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, Neural Networks) and compare results.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: 
- For Project 1, explore using different clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN) and compare their results.
- For Project 2, incorporate external factors (e.g., economic indicators) into the forecasting model and assess their impact.
- For Project 3, implement an ensemble approach combining multiple models and evaluate its effectiveness in improving detection rates.
