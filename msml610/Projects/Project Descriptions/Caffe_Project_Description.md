### Project 1: Image Classification of Fashion Items
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: Build a model that classifies images of fashion items into categories (e.g., shirts, shoes, bags) using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Fashion MNIST dataset available on Kaggle: [Fashion MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist)

**Tasks**:
- **Set Up Caffe Environment**: Install Caffe and set up the development environment.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Load the Fashion MNIST dataset, resize images, and normalize pixel values.
- **Define CNN Architecture**: Use Caffe's prototxt files to define a simple CNN model.
- **Train Model**: Train the CNN on the Fashion MNIST dataset and monitor the training process.
- **Evaluate Performance**: Test the model on a validation set and calculate accuracy and loss metrics.
- **Visualization**: Use Matplotlib to visualize training loss and accuracy over epochs.

### Project 2: Image Segmentation of Medical Images
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: Create a model to segment and identify tumors in MRI scans using a U-Net architecture.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) dataset available on Kaggle: [BraTS 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/braindataset)

**Tasks**:
- **Set Up Caffe Environment**: Ensure Caffe is properly installed with all necessary dependencies.
- **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess MRI images, including resizing and augmenting the dataset.
- **Define U-Net Architecture**: Create a U-Net model using Caffe's prototxt files for image segmentation.
- **Train U-Net Model**: Train the model on the segmented images and monitor the training process using metrics like IoU (Intersection over Union).
- **Evaluate Segmentation**: Assess the model's performance on a test set and visualize segmentation results overlaid on original images.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different learning rates and batch sizes to optimize performance.

### Project 3: Real-time Object Detection in Video Streams
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: Develop a real-time object detection system that identifies and tracks multiple objects in video streams using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- COCO dataset (Common Objects in Context) available on the official COCO website: [COCO Dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home)

**Tasks**:
- **Set Up Caffe with YOLO**: Install Caffe and configure it for YOLO model training.
- **Data Preparation**: Download and preprocess the COCO dataset, ensuring proper annotations for object detection.
- **Define YOLO Architecture**: Use Caffe's prototxt files to define the YOLO architecture for object detection tasks.
- **Train YOLO Model**: Train the model on the COCO dataset, adjusting parameters for optimal performance.
- **Real-time Video Processing**: Implement a pipeline to capture video from a webcam and apply the trained YOLO model for detection.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Measure detection accuracy and processing speed, and visualize bounding boxes on detected objects in real-time.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- For Project 1: Experiment with different architectures (e.g., ResNet) and compare their performance.
- For Project 2: Apply transfer learning using pre-trained models to improve segmentation accuracy.
- For Project 3: Implement a tracking algorithm (e.g., SORT or Deep SORT) to maintain object identities across frames.
