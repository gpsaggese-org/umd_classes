### Project 3: Forecasting Stock Prices with Time Series Analysis (Difficulty: 3 - Hard)

**Project Objective**: Build a time series forecasting model to predict future stock prices based on historical data, optimizing the model's hyperparameters to enhance forecasting accuracy.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "S&P 500 Stock Prices" dataset available on Yahoo Finance or Kaggle, which contains historical stock prices and trading volumes.

**Tasks**:
- Data Collection:
  - Fetch historical stock price data using the Yahoo Finance API or download from Kaggle.
- Data Preprocessing:
  - Clean the dataset by handling missing values and creating features like moving averages.
- Model Selection:
  - Choose a time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA or LSTM).
- Hyperparameter Optimization:
  - Utilize Scikit-Optimize to tune hyperparameters such as ARIMA orders (p, d, q) or LSTM layers and units.
- Model Evaluation:
  - Assess model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) or Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Forecasting:
  - Generate future stock price predictions and visualize the forecast against historical data.

**Bonus Ideas**:
- Compare the performance of different time series models (e.g., ARIMA vs. LSTM).
- Implement a rolling forecast to evaluate model performance over time.
