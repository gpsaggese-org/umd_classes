**Description**

Loralib is a powerful library for creating and optimizing low-rank approximations of large matrices, particularly useful in machine learning and data science for dimensionality reduction tasks. This tool allows for efficient matrix factorization, enabling faster computation and better performance in various applications such as collaborative filtering and image processing.

**Project 1: Movie Recommendation System**  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: Develop a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering to predict user ratings based on past interactions, optimizing for user satisfaction and diversity in recommendations.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **MovieLens 100K** dataset available on Kaggle: [MovieLens 100K](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean the MovieLens dataset, handling missing values and formatting issues.
- **Matrix Factorization**: Apply Loralib to perform low-rank approximation on the user-item rating matrix.
- **Recommendation Generation**: Use the factorized matrices to predict missing ratings and generate a list of recommended movies for users.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the recommendation accuracy using metrics like RMSE and precision at k.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Incorporate user demographics to enhance recommendations.  
- Compare Loralib's performance with other recommendation algorithms like SVD or KNN.

**Project 2: Image Compression and Reconstruction**  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: Implement an image compression algorithm using low-rank matrix approximation to reduce the size of image files while maintaining visual quality, optimizing for storage efficiency.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **CIFAR-10** dataset available on Kaggle: [CIFAR-10](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Loading**: Load the CIFAR-10 dataset and select a subset of images for processing.
- **Image Reshaping**: Convert images into matrices suitable for low-rank approximation.
- **Compression**: Use Loralib to compress the image matrices, retaining essential features while reducing dimensionality.
- **Reconstruction**: Reconstruct images from the compressed data and evaluate the quality using PSNR and SSIM metrics.
- **Visualization**: Display original and reconstructed images to visually assess compression effectiveness.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Experiment with different ranks to analyze the trade-off between compression rate and image quality.  
- Extend to video compression by processing frames as a tensor.
