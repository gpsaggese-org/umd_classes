**Description**

CleanRL is a Python library designed for Reinforcement Learning (RL) that provides a clean and simple interface for implementing various RL algorithms. It focuses on ease of use and clarity, allowing users to quickly prototype and experiment with different RL methods. The library is built on top of PyTorch and is highly modular, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced users.

Technologies Used
CleanRL

- Implements a variety of state-of-the-art RL algorithms with minimal boilerplate code.
- Supports environments from OpenAI Gym, making it easy to test and evaluate RL agents.
- Provides utilities for logging and visualizing training progress.

### Project 1: Basic Reinforcement Learning with CartPole
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: Develop a reinforcement learning agent that can balance a pole on a moving cart using the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the reward by keeping the pole upright for as long as possible.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- No external dataset is required; the CartPole environment is available directly through OpenAI Gym.

**Tasks**:
- **Set Up Environment**: Install CleanRL and OpenAI Gym, and create the CartPole environment.
- **Implement RL Algorithm**: Use a simple policy gradient method (e.g., REINFORCE) to train the agent.
- **Train the Agent**: Run multiple episodes, allowing the agent to learn from its actions and improve over time.
- **Evaluate Performance**: Track the average reward per episode and visualize the training process using Matplotlib.
- **Fine-Tune Hyperparameters**: Experiment with learning rates and other parameters to optimize performance.

### Project 2: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in a Grid World
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)

**Project Objective**: Create a multi-agent reinforcement learning system where agents must collaborate to reach designated goals in a grid world. The objective is to optimize the agents' policies for effective teamwork.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- No external dataset is required; the grid world can be simulated using a custom environment created with OpenAI Gym.

**Tasks**:
- **Design Grid World Environment**: Implement a custom grid world environment where agents can move and interact.
- **Implement Multi-Agent Algorithm**: Use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train multiple agents simultaneously.
- **Agent Collaboration**: Implement a reward system that encourages cooperation between agents to achieve their goals.
- **Evaluate and Visualize**: Analyze the performance of agents through training metrics and visualize their paths in the grid.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different configurations for the PPO algorithm and agent interactions.

### Project 3: Reinforcement Learning for Stock Trading
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: Develop a reinforcement learning agent that learns to trade stocks based on historical price data. The goal is to maximize cumulative returns through effective trading strategies.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "S&P 500 Stock Data" dataset available on Kaggle, which contains historical price information for multiple stocks.

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preparation**: Preprocess the stock data to create features such as moving averages, volatility, and other indicators.
- **Design Trading Environment**: Create a custom trading environment that simulates buying and selling stocks based on actions taken by the RL agent.
- **Implement Advanced RL Algorithm**: Use Deep Q-Learning (DQN) or Actor-Critic methods to train the trading agent.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Train the agent over multiple episodes and evaluate its performance based on cumulative returns and risk metrics.
- **Backtesting**: Implement a backtesting framework to simulate the agent's trading performance on unseen data.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- For Project 1: Experiment with different environments in OpenAI Gym, such as MountainCar or LunarLander.
- For Project 2: Introduce obstacles in the grid world that agents must navigate around, adding complexity to the environment.
- For Project 3: Integrate news sentiment analysis to influence trading decisions, using a public API like NewsAPI to gather relevant news articles.
