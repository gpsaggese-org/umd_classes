### Project 1: Predicting Housing Prices

**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: The goal is to build a regression model to predict housing prices based on various features like location, size, and number of bedrooms. The project will optimize the model for the lowest mean absolute error (MAE).

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Ames Housing Dataset" available on Kaggle: [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prestonvong/AmesHousing).

**Tasks**:
- Data Loading:
  - Load the Ames Housing dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Data Preprocessing:
  - Handle missing values and perform necessary feature engineering.
- Model Training:
  - Use Ray[train] to distribute the training of a regression model (e.g., Random Forest).
- Model Evaluation:
  - Evaluate the model's performance using mean absolute error and visualize results.
- Hyperparameter Tuning:
  - Implement Ray Tune to optimize hyperparameters for better accuracy.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Compare different regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression vs. Random Forest).
- Implement feature importance analysis to understand which features most affect housing prices.

### Project 2: Customer Segmentation for E-commerce

**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)

**Project Objective**: The aim is to implement clustering techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, optimizing for distinct and meaningful clusters.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Online Retail Dataset" available on UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail).

**Tasks**:
- Data Preparation:
  - Load the dataset and preprocess it by cleaning and transforming the data into a suitable format.
- Feature Engineering:
  - Create features such as total spending, frequency of purchases, and recency of last purchase.
- Clustering:
  - Use Ray[train] to perform distributed K-means clustering on the dataset.
- Cluster Analysis:
  - Analyze and visualize the resulting clusters to identify customer segments.
- Model Evaluation:
  - Evaluate clustering quality using silhouette scores and visualize clusters.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Experiment with different clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering).
- Create a dashboard using Plotly Dash to visualize customer segments interactively.

### Project 3: Real-time Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic

**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: The project aims to develop a real-time anomaly detection system for network traffic data, optimizing for the detection of unusual patterns that may indicate security threats.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "CICIDS 2017 Dataset" available on Kaggle: [CICIDS 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadkhalid/cicids-2017).

**Tasks**:
- Data Ingestion:
  - Load the CICIDS 2017 dataset and preprocess it for analysis.
- Feature Engineering:
  - Extract relevant features from the raw network traffic data for anomaly detection.
- Anomaly Detection Model:
  - Implement a machine learning model (e.g., Isolation Forest) using Ray[train] for distributed training.
- Real-time Processing:
  - Set up a pipeline that simulates real-time data ingestion and anomaly detection.
- Model Evaluation:
  - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
