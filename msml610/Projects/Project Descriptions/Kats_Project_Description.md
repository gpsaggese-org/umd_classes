**Project 1: Stock Price Forecasting**  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: Develop a model to forecast future stock prices for a selected company based on historical price data.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Yahoo Finance Stock Price Data" available via the Yahoo Finance API, which provides free access to historical stock prices.

**Tasks**:
- Data Collection:
    - Fetch historical stock price data for a chosen company using the Yahoo Finance API.
    - Store the data in a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
  
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and formatting dates.
  
- Time Series Forecasting:
    - Utilize Kats to implement a simple ARIMA model to predict future stock prices.
  
- Model Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
  
- Visualization:
    - Plot the historical prices and forecasted values to visualize the model's accuracy.

**Project 2: Anomaly Detection in Energy Consumption**  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: Identify anomalies in energy consumption data for a building over time to detect unusual usage patterns.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Energy Consumption" dataset available on Kaggle, which includes hourly energy consumption data for buildings.

**Tasks**:
- Data Collection:
    - Download and load the energy consumption data from Kaggle into a Pandas DataFrame.
  
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Clean the dataset, ensuring timestamps are in the correct format and handling any missing values.
  
- Anomaly Detection:
    - Implement Kats to detect anomalies in energy consumption using its anomaly detection features.
  
- Visualization:
    - Create visualizations to highlight detected anomalies compared to normal usage patterns.
  
- Report Findings:
    - Summarize the findings, discussing potential reasons for anomalies and implications for energy management.

**Project 3: Multi-Seasonal Time Series Forecasting for Retail Sales**  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: Build a forecasting model to predict future retail sales while accounting for multiple seasonal effects like holidays and promotions.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting" dataset available on Kaggle, which includes historical sales data with seasonal trends.

**Tasks**:
- Data Collection:
    - Load the retail sales data from Kaggle and structure it for analysis.
  
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Clean the data, ensuring proper formatting of dates and handling missing values, and create additional features to capture seasonal effects (e.g., holidays).
  
- Multi-Seasonal Forecasting:
    - Use Kats to implement a multi-seasonal forecasting model, such as a seasonal ARIMA or Prophet model, to predict future sales.
  
- Model Evaluation:
    - Assess the model's performance with appropriate metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE) and compare with a baseline model.
  
- Visualization:
    - Visualize the historical sales data alongside the forecasted values, highlighting seasonal trends and promotional impacts.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- For Project 1, explore using additional features like trading volume or news sentiment for improved forecasting accuracy.
- For Project 2, implement a real-time monitoring system that alerts users when anomalies are detected using a simple dashboard.
- For Project 3, consider integrating external economic indicators (e.g., unemployment rates) to enhance the forecasting model's robustness.
