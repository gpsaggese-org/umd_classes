### Project 3: Time Series Forecasting of Stock Prices
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: Create a forecasting model for stock prices using historical data, optimizing model parameters through Ray Tune to enhance predictive accuracy.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "S&P 500 Stock Data" from Kaggle, which includes historical stock prices.

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the time series data, including handling missing values and creating lag features.
- **Model Selection**: Choose a forecasting model (e.g., LSTM or ARIMA) suitable for time series analysis.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Implement Ray Tune to optimize hyperparameters such as the number of LSTM layers, dropout rates, and learning rates.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Visualization**: Visualize the forecasted stock prices against actual prices over time using Matplotlib.

**Bonus Ideas**: 
- For Project 1, compare the performance of different regression models after hyperparameter tuning.
- For Project 2, experiment with different pre-trained models (e.g., InceptionV3, VGG16) and compare their performance.
- For Project 3, explore additional features such as technical indicators (moving averages, RSI) to improve forecasting accuracy.
