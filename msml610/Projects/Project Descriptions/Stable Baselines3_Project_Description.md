**Description**

Stable Baselines3 is a set of reliable implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms in Python. It provides a user-friendly interface for developing and training reinforcement learning agents, making it easier to experiment with various algorithms and environments. Key features include:

- **Multiple Algorithms**: Supports popular algorithms like PPO, DDPG, A2C, and SAC.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with OpenAI Gym environments for testing and training.
- **Pre-trained Agents**: Offers pre-trained models to kickstart projects and facilitate comparison.
- **Custom Callbacks**: Allows for custom training callbacks for monitoring and logging.

### Project 1: Reinforcement Learning for Cart-Pole Balancing
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: The goal is to train an agent to balance a pole on a cart using reinforcement learning. The agent will learn to control the cart's position to keep the pole upright for as long as possible.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the OpenAI Gym's CartPole-v1 environment (no external dataset needed).

**Tasks**:
- **Set Up Environment**: Initialize the CartPole environment using OpenAI Gym.
- **Define the Agent**: Create a PPO agent using Stable Baselines3.
- **Train the Agent**: Train the agent in the CartPole environment and monitor its performance.
- **Evaluate Performance**: Test the trained agent and measure the average reward over multiple episodes.
- **Visualize Results**: Plot the training rewards over time to visualize learning progress.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Experiment with different hyperparameters (learning rate, gamma) to optimize performance.
- Compare the performance of different algorithms (PPO vs. DDPG) on the same task.

### Project 2: Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)

**Project Objective**: Develop a reinforcement learning agent to optimize traffic signal timings in a simulated intersection to minimize waiting time and improve traffic flow.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the Traffic Signal Control environment from the OpenAI Gym (e.g., `TrafficLight`).

**Tasks**:
- **Set Up Environment**: Configure the Traffic Signal Control environment.
- **Agent Design**: Implement a DQN agent using Stable Baselines3 for controlling traffic lights.
- **Training**: Train the agent to learn optimal signal timings based on traffic flow data.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Measure the average waiting time and throughput of vehicles.
- **Visualization**: Create visualizations to compare the performance of the RL agent against fixed signal timings.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Integrate additional state information (e.g., pedestrian crossings) into the agent's decision-making process.
- Implement a multi-agent system where multiple intersections coordinate with each other.

### Project 3: Reinforcement Learning for Stock Trading Strategy
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: Create a reinforcement learning agent that learns to make buy/sell/hold decisions in stock trading based on historical price data to maximize returns.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the `Alpha Vantage` API to gather historical stock price data (free tier available).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Collection**: Use the Alpha Vantage API to fetch historical stock data (e.g., daily prices for a specific stock).
- **Environment Setup**: Create a custom trading environment compatible with Stable Baselines3 where the agent can interact with stock prices.
- **Agent Design**: Implement an A2C agent to learn trading strategies based on the defined environment.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Train the agent and evaluate its performance based on cumulative returns and risk metrics.
- **Visualization**: Plot the agent's trading decisions against actual stock price movements to analyze performance.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Experiment with different reward structures (e.g., penalizing for high drawdowns).
- Compare the RL agent's performance with traditional trading strategies (e.g., moving average crossover).
