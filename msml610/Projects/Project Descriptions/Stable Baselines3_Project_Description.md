### Project 1: Simple Game AI (Difficulty: 1)

**Project Objective**: Develop a reinforcement learning agent that can play a simple game (e.g., CartPole) and optimize its score.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the OpenAI Gym environment, specifically the `CartPole-v1` environment.

**Tasks**:
- Set up the Gym environment and visualize the game.
- Implement a PPO agent using Stable Baselines3.
- Train the agent and log its performance over episodes.
- Evaluate the trained agent and visualize its performance.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: Experiment with different hyperparameters for the PPO agent and compare their performance.

### Project 2: Stock Trading Agent (Difficulty: 2)

**Project Objective**: Create a reinforcement learning agent that learns to trade stocks based on historical price data, optimizing for maximum profit.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the `S&P 500 Historical Data` dataset available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sbhatti/stock-market-data).

**Tasks**:
- Preprocess the stock price data and create a trading environment using the Gym framework.
- Implement a DDPG agent using Stable Baselines3 for continuous action space.
- Train the agent and evaluate its trading performance against a buy-and-hold strategy.
- Analyze the agent’s trading strategy and visualize profit and loss over time.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: Incorporate additional features like technical indicators (e.g., moving averages) to improve the agent's decision-making process.

### Project 3: Autonomous Driving Simulation (Difficulty: 3)

**Project Objective**: Build a reinforcement learning agent that can navigate a simulated driving environment while avoiding obstacles and optimizing for safe and efficient driving.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the `CarRacing-v0` environment from OpenAI Gym, which provides a driving simulation.

**Tasks**:
- Set up the CarRacing environment and visualize the simulation.
- Implement a PPO agent using Stable Baselines3 tailored for continuous action spaces.
- Train the agent using various reward functions to balance speed and safety.
- Evaluate the agent’s performance and visualize its driving path, including obstacles encountered.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: Experiment with different reward strategies (e.g., penalties for collisions) and assess their impact on the agent's learning and performance.
