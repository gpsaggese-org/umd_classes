**Description of RLlib:**
RLlib is a scalable reinforcement learning library built on Ray, designed to facilitate the development and deployment of reinforcement learning algorithms. It provides a unified API for various RL algorithms, support for multi-agent systems, and easy integration with other libraries. Key features include:
- Support for a variety of state-of-the-art RL algorithms.
- Multi-agent training capabilities.
- Built-in support for distributed training.
- High-level abstractions for environment creation and training.

### Project 1: Basic Reinforcement Learning with Grid World
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: Implement a basic reinforcement learning agent to learn optimal policies in a Grid World environment, optimizing for maximum cumulative rewards.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Simulated Grid World environment (create a custom environment using OpenAI Gym).

**Tasks**:
- **Environment Setup**: Create a Grid World environment using OpenAI Gym.
- **Agent Implementation**: Use RLlib to implement a Q-learning agent.
- **Training**: Train the agent in the Grid World environment and evaluate its performance.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the agent's learned policy and rewards over episodes.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: Experiment with different reward structures or modify the grid layout to create more complex environments.

### Project 2: Reinforcement Learning for CartPole Balancing
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)

**Project Objective**: Develop a reinforcement learning agent that can balance a pole on a moving cart, optimizing for the longest time the pole remains upright.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- OpenAI Gym's CartPole environment (available directly through the library).

**Tasks**:
- **Environment Selection**: Import the CartPole environment from OpenAI Gym.
- **Agent Creation**: Utilize RLlib to implement a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize the agent's performance.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the agent's performance and visualize the average reward over multiple episodes.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: Compare the performance of different algorithms in RLlib (e.g., PPO vs. DQN) on the same task.

### Project 3: Autonomous Drone Navigation Difficulty: 3 (Hard)


**Project Objective**
Build a reinforcement learning agent that controls a drone (or simulated vehicle) to navigate through an environment, avoiding obstacles and reaching a target location.

**Dataset Suggestions**

Default (lightweight): Use PyBulletâ€™s drone or continuous-control environments (e.g., LunarLanderContinuous-v2) for fast training on laptops/Colab.

**Tasks**

- Set Up Simulation Environment
  Default: Install PyBullet and configure a simple drone or continuous-control navigation task (e.g., LunarLanderContinuous).

- Implement RL Agent
  Use RLlib to create an A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) agent for continuous action spaces.
  Define state (e.g., position, velocity, orientation) and action (thrust, pitch, yaw).

- Train the Agent
  Train agents to navigate toward a goal while avoiding obstacles.
  Experiment with different reward functions (e.g., penalties for collisions, bonuses for smooth flight).

- Performance Evaluation
  Metrics: task completion rate, average time to goal, number of collisions.
  Evaluate across multiple episodes under varied initial conditions.

- Visualization
  Default: Use 2D/3D plots in Matplotlib or PyBullet built-in viewers to show flight paths.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**

 - Implement different weather or lighting conditions (AirSim).
 - Explore multi-agent coordination (multiple drones reaching goals simultaneously).
 - Compare A3C with PPO or SAC for continuous navigation.
 - Add energy efficiency metrics (penalize excessive thrust).
