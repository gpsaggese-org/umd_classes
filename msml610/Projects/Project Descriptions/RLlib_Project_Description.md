**Description**

RLlib is an open-source library for reinforcement learning (RL) built on top of Ray, designed to enable scalable and distributed RL algorithms. It provides a unified API for various RL algorithms, making it easier to train and evaluate agents in complex environments. With RLlib, users can leverage pre-built environments and customize their training processes while benefiting from efficient parallel execution.

Technologies Used
RLlib

- Supports a wide range of RL algorithms, including DQN, PPO, and A3C.
- Facilitates easy integration with popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- Allows for distributed training across multiple nodes and environments.
