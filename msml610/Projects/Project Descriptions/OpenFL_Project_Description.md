**Description**

OpenFL is an open-source framework for federated learning that enables collaborative machine learning across decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy. It allows data scientists to build and train models without needing to centralize sensitive data, making it ideal for applications in healthcare, finance, and other privacy-sensitive domains. 

Technologies Used
OpenFL

- Facilitates federated learning, allowing multiple parties to collaboratively train models while keeping their data localized.
- Supports various machine learning frameworks, including TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- Provides tools for model aggregation, communication protocols, and privacy-preserving techniques.

### Project 1: Federated Learning for Handwritten Digit Recognition
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: 
Develop a federated learning model to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset, enabling multiple clients to train on their local data while contributing to a global model.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- MNIST dataset, available on Kaggle: [MNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data).

**Tasks**:
- Set Up OpenFL Environment:
    - Install OpenFL and required libraries on local machines or Google Colab.
- Prepare Local Datasets:
    - Split the MNIST dataset into subsets for simulated client environments.
- Implement Federated Learning:
    - Create a federated learning setup with multiple clients training their models locally.
- Model Aggregation:
    - Use OpenFL's aggregation methods to combine local models into a global model.
- Evaluate Model Performance:
    - Test the global model on a separate validation set and report accuracy.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Experiment with different model architectures (e.g., CNN) for improved accuracy.
- Compare performance metrics of federated learning versus centralized training.
