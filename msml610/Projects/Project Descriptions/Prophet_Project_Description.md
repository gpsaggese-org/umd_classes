**Description**

Prophet is an open-source forecasting tool developed by Facebook, designed to handle time series data that may have seasonal effects and missing values. It provides an intuitive interface for users to create forecasts without requiring extensive knowledge of time series analysis. Prophet is particularly effective for daily observations with seasonal patterns and can be tuned with holiday effects to improve accuracy.

Technologies Used
Prophet

- Handles missing data and outliers effectively.
- Supports seasonal effects (daily, weekly, yearly) for robust forecasting.
- Allows for intuitive parameter tuning and holiday effects integration.

**Project 1: Sales Forecasting for a Retail Store**  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: To forecast future sales for a retail store using historical sales data to optimize inventory management and sales strategies.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting" dataset on Kaggle. 

**Tasks**:
- Data Preparation:
    - Load the dataset and preprocess it to handle missing values and date formats.
- Time Series Decomposition:
    - Use Prophet to analyze seasonal patterns in the sales data.
- Forecasting:
    - Create forecasts for the next three months and visualize the results.
- Evaluation:
    - Compare the forecasted sales with actual sales using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: 
- Incorporate holiday effects to see how they impact sales.
- Compare Prophet's forecasts with a simple moving average model.

**Project 2: Forecasting COVID-19 Cases**  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: To develop a forecasting model for daily COVID-19 cases in a specific region to assist in public health planning and resource allocation.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Utilize the "COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University" available on GitHub.

**Tasks**:
- Data Collection:
    - Extract daily case counts for the selected region from the GitHub repository.
- Data Cleaning:
    - Process the data to handle missing values and aggregate cases by day.
- Model Development:
    - Use Prophet to create a forecasting model for the next month.
- Visualization:
    - Plot the forecasted cases along with confidence intervals to visualize uncertainty.
- Evaluation:
    - Assess the model's accuracy by comparing forecasts with actual case counts.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: 
- Examine the impact of vaccination rates on the forecasting model.
- Implement additional features such as mobility data to improve the model's accuracy.

**Project 3: Energy Consumption Forecasting**  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: To predict future energy consumption of a city based on historical usage data, allowing for better energy distribution and management.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Household Electric Power Consumption" dataset available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Clean and transform the dataset to create daily aggregate energy consumption values.
- Seasonal Analysis:
    - Use Prophet to analyze seasonal trends and weekly cycles in energy consumption.
- Forecasting:
    - Develop a forecasting model for the next six months, including holiday effects.
- Model Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the model using RMSE and visualize the results with Matplotlib.
- Scenario Analysis:
    - Create different scenarios based on potential changes in energy policy or external factors.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: 
- Integrate weather data to analyze its impact on energy consumption.
- Compare the forecasting performance of Prophet with ARIMA or LSTM models.
