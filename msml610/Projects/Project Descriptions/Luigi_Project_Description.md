**Description**

Luigi is a Python package that helps build complex data pipelines and workflows. It is particularly useful for managing dependencies and scheduling tasks. With Luigi, users can define tasks and their dependencies, track the progress of tasks, and ensure that data processing is efficient and reproducible. 

Technologies Used
Luigi

- Facilitates the creation of data pipelines with task dependencies.
- Provides a visual interface to monitor pipeline execution.
- Supports various output formats and can integrate with databases and cloud storage.

### Project 1: Movie Recommendation Pipeline
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: Build a simple movie recommendation system that processes user ratings and movie metadata to suggest movies based on collaborative filtering.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- MovieLens 100K dataset available on Kaggle: [MovieLens 100K](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/)

**Tasks**:
- **Set Up Luigi Pipeline**: Define tasks for data loading, preprocessing, and model training.
- **Load Data**: Create a task to load the MovieLens dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implement a task to clean and preprocess the data (e.g., handling missing values).
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Build a task to train a collaborative filtering model using Surprise library.
- **Generate Recommendations**: Create a task that generates movie recommendations for users based on the trained model.
- **Visualization**: Implement a task that visualizes the most recommended movies using Matplotlib.

### Project 2: Weather Data Analysis and Forecasting
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: Create a data pipeline that ingests weather data from an API, performs exploratory data analysis, and builds a forecasting model to predict future weather conditions.

**Dataset Suggestions**:
- OpenWeatherMap API (free tier) for real-time weather data: [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)

**Tasks**:
- **Set Up Luigi Pipeline**: Define tasks for data ingestion, analysis, and modeling.
- **Ingest Data**: Create a task to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and save it to a CSV file.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Implement a task for EDA to visualize trends and correlations in the weather data using Seaborn.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create a task to engineer features from the raw weather data (e.g., temperature averages, humidity levels).
- **Model Training**: Build a task to train a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA or Prophet) on the processed data.
- **Evaluation**: Implement a task to evaluate the model's performance using metrics like RMSE and visualize results.

### Project 3: E-commerce Sales Prediction Pipeline
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: Develop a robust data pipeline that processes historical e-commerce sales data, extracts features, and builds a machine learning model to predict future sales.

**Dataset Suggestions**:
- Kaggle's "E-commerce Sales Data" dataset: [E-commerce Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/irfanasrullah/ecommerce-sales-data)

**Tasks**:
- **Set Up Luigi Pipeline**: Define a comprehensive pipeline with tasks for data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- **Load Sales Data**: Create a task to load the e-commerce sales dataset and store it in a structured format.
- **Data Cleaning**: Implement a task to clean the data, including handling outliers and missing values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create a task that extracts relevant features (e.g., seasonal trends, promotional events) from the sales data.
- **Model Training**: Build a task to train a regression model (e.g., Random Forest or XGBoost) on the processed features.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implement a task that performs hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Create a task to evaluate the model using cross-validation and visualize the predictions against actual sales.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: 
- For the Movie Recommendation Pipeline, consider integrating a content-based filtering approach for a hybrid recommendation system.
- For the Weather Data Analysis, explore anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual weather patterns.
- For the E-commerce Sales Prediction, extend the project to include a dashboard for real-time sales monitoring and predictions using Streamlit or Dash.
