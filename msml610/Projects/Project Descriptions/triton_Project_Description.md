**Project 3: Anomaly Detection in Time-Series Data (Difficulty: 3)**

**Project Objective:**  
Create a robust anomaly detection system for time-series data using Triton to identify unusual patterns in stock price data. The goal is to optimize the model for both detection accuracy and processing speed.

**Dataset Suggestions:**  
Yahoo Finance stock prices dataset, accessible via the `yfinance` library: [Yahoo Finance API](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)

**Tasks:**
- **Set Up Triton Environment:**  
  Configure Triton with necessary libraries for time-series analysis and anomaly detection.

- **Ingest Stock Price Data:**  
  Fetch historical stock prices using the `yfinance` library and preprocess the data (handling missing values, normalization).

- **Implement Anomaly Detection Model:**  
  Create a model (e.g., LSTM or Isolation Forest) in Triton tailored for time-series anomaly detection.

- **Train and Optimize the Model:**  
  Train the model using Triton’s GPU capabilities, tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

- **Evaluate and Visualize Anomalies:**  
  Detect anomalies in the stock prices and visualize the results using time-series plots with Matplotlib.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional):**  
- Experiment with different model architectures (e.g., GRU, Transformer) for text generation.
- Implement a real-time anomaly detection system that streams stock price data.
- Compare the performance of Triton-optimized models against traditional implementations in TensorFlow or PyTorch.
