## Description  
AutoKeras is an open-source software library designed for automated machine learning (AutoML) that simplifies the process of model selection and hyperparameter tuning. It allows users to quickly build and evaluate deep learning models without extensive knowledge of the underlying algorithms. Key features include:  

- **Neural Architecture Search**: Automatically searches for the best model architecture for the given task.  
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Efficiently optimizes model parameters to improve performance.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies model training and evaluation with intuitive APIs.  
- **Support for Various Data Types**: Handles image, text, time series, and tabular data seamlessly.

### Project 3: Electricity Load Forecasting  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  

**Project Objective**:  
Forecast hourly electricity demand using historical energy consumption data. AutoKeras will automate model selection and hyperparameter tuning for time series forecasting.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: Hourly Energy Consumption Dataset  
- **Link**: [Electricity Load Forecasting (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, create time-based features (lags, rolling averages), and normalize values.  
- **Model Training with AutoKeras**: Use AutoKeras’ TimeSeriesForecaster to predict future energy consumption.  
- **Model Comparison**: Compare AutoKeras’ forecasting model with baselines (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM).  
- **Evaluation**: Use metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE to evaluate performance.  
- **Visualization**: Plot actual vs. predicted energy demand curves.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Explore multi-step forecasting (predicting several hours ahead).  
- Incorporate external data (e.g., weather conditions) to improve forecasts.  
- Build a dashboard that visualizes real-time forecasts and updates dynamically.
