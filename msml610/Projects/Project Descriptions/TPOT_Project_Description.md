**Description**

TPOT is an open-source Python library that automates the process of machine learning model selection and hyperparameter tuning using genetic programming. It optimizes machine learning pipelines by evolving them over generations, allowing users to discover the best models and preprocessing steps for their datasets. 

Features of TPOT:
- Automates the machine learning pipeline creation and optimization process.
- Utilizes genetic programming to evolve models based on performance metrics.
- Supports a wide range of machine learning algorithms, including classification, regression, and feature selection.

**Project 1: Predicting Housing Prices**  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: The goal is to predict housing prices based on various features such as location, size, and number of bedrooms using regression techniques.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Use the "California Housing Prices" dataset available on Kaggle: [California Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/housing-prices)  

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing:
  - Load the dataset and handle missing values and categorical features.
  
- Feature Engineering:
  - Create new features based on existing ones (e.g., price per square foot).
  
- TPOT Pipeline Creation:
  - Utilize TPOT to automatically generate and optimize a regression pipeline for predicting housing prices.

- Model Evaluation:
  - Evaluate the best model generated by TPOT using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².

- Results Interpretation:
  - Analyze the results to understand feature importance and model performance.

**Project 2: Customer Churn Prediction**  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: The aim is to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company using classification techniques to identify customers likely to leave.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Use the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset from Kaggle: [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)  

**Tasks**:
- Data Exploration:
  - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior and identify key features.

- Data Preprocessing:
  - Clean the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

- TPOT Pipeline Development:
  - Use TPOT to automate the creation of a classification pipeline for predicting churn.

- Model Evaluation:
  - Assess the performance of the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- Insights Generation:
  - Generate insights on the most influential factors contributing to customer churn.

**Project 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection**  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: The goal is to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data using anomaly detection techniques and classification algorithms.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Use the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset available on Kaggle: [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dalpozz/creditcard-fraud)  

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing:
  - Analyze and preprocess the dataset, addressing class imbalance through techniques like SMOTE.

- Feature Engineering:
  - Extract relevant features and create new ones to enhance model performance.

- TPOT Pipeline Optimization:
  - Employ TPOT to create and optimize a classification pipeline specifically for fraud detection.

- Model Evaluation:
  - Evaluate the model using confusion matrix, ROC-AUC score, and precision-recall curves.

- Model Deployment Considerations:
  - Discuss how to deploy the model in a real-time fraud detection system and the implications of false positives/negatives.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- For Project 1, try to implement additional regression techniques manually and compare them with TPOT's results.  
- For Project 2, explore the use of ensemble methods and compare their performance with TPOT's best model.  
- For Project 3, consider integrating a real-time API to simulate live fraud detection and evaluate model performance in a streaming context.
