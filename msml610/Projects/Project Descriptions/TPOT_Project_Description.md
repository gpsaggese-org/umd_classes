**Tool Description: TPOT**  
TPOT (Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool) is an open-source Python library that automates the process of designing and optimizing machine learning pipelines using genetic programming. It helps users identify the best models and preprocessing steps for their datasets with minimal manual intervention. Key features include:
- Automated machine learning pipeline optimization.
- Support for various supervised learning tasks (classification, regression).
- Integration with popular libraries like scikit-learn.
- Ability to export optimized pipelines as Python code.

### Project 1: Predicting Heart Disease (Difficulty: 1 - Easy)

**Project Objective:**  
Predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical attributes.

**Dataset Suggestions:**  
Use the "Heart Disease UCI" dataset available on Kaggle: [Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).

**Tasks:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Load and clean the dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Feature Selection:** Use TPOT to identify the most relevant features for predicting heart disease.
- **Model Training:** Train multiple models using TPOT's automated pipeline optimization.
- **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional):**  
- Compare TPOT's results with a manually built model using scikit-learn.
- Visualize the importance of features selected by TPOT.

### Project 2: Customer Segmentation for E-commerce (Difficulty: 2 - Medium)

**Project Objective:**  
Segment customers based on purchasing behavior to enhance marketing strategies.

**Dataset Suggestions:**  
Utilize the "Online Retail" dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Online Retail](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail).

**Tasks:**
- **Data Cleaning:** Process the dataset to remove duplicates and handle missing values.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create features such as total spending, frequency of purchases, and recency of last purchase.
- **Pipeline Optimization:** Use TPOT to automate the selection of clustering algorithms to segment customers.
- **Analysis:** Evaluate the clustering results and visualize segments using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional):**  
- Implement a baseline clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means) and compare its performance with TPOT's output.
- Explore how different features impact customer segmentation.

### Project 3: Predicting Stock Prices Using News Sentiment (Difficulty: 3 - Hard)

**Project Objective:**  
Predict stock price movements based on historical data and sentiment analysis of financial news articles.

**Dataset Suggestions:**  
Combine the "Financial News" dataset from Kaggle: [Financial News Sentiment Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sbhatti/financial-news) with historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance API (free to use).

**Tasks:**
- **Data Integration:** Merge stock price data with sentiment scores derived from news articles.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create time-series features and sentiment-related features for model input.
- **Automated Pipeline:** Use TPOT to optimize a regression model predicting stock price movements.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model using metrics like RMSE and R-squared, and visualize predictions against actual stock prices.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional):**  
- Experiment with different sentiment analysis libraries (e.g., VADER, TextBlob) and compare their impact on model performance.
- Explore the effect of including additional market indicators (e.g., trading volume) on prediction accuracy.
