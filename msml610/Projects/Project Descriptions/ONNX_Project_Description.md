**Description**

ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open-source format that enables the interoperability of machine learning models across various frameworks. It allows developers to transfer models between different platforms without the need for re-engineering. 

Technologies Used
ONNX

- Facilitates model conversion between popular frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn.
- Supports a wide range of pre-trained models for various tasks.
- Optimizes models for performance on different hardware platforms.

**Project 1: Image Classification of Handwritten Digits**  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: Build a simple image classification model to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, optimizing accuracy and performance using ONNX for model conversion.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset available on Kaggle: [MNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Load the MNIST dataset, normalize pixel values, and split it into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Use a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch to train on the MNIST dataset.
- **Export to ONNX**: Convert the trained model to ONNX format for compatibility with other frameworks.
- **Inference with ONNX**: Load the ONNX model in a different environment (e.g., TensorFlow) and perform inference on the test set.
- **Evaluate Performance**: Measure the accuracy of predictions and compare it with the original PyTorch model.

**Bonus Ideas**: 
- Experiment with different model architectures (e.g., deeper CNNs) and compare performance.
- Implement model quantization to reduce the model size and improve inference speed.

**Project 2: Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews**  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: Develop a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, optimizing the model using ONNX for deployment across different platforms.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset available on Kaggle: [IMDb Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preparation**: Load the IMDb dataset, clean text data, and perform tokenization and padding.
- **Model Development**: Build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model in TensorFlow/Keras for sentiment classification.
- **Convert to ONNX**: Export the trained model to ONNX format for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Inference in Another Framework**: Load the ONNX model in a different environment (e.g., PyTorch) and run inference on a sample of reviews.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Analyze metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall on the test set.

**Bonus Ideas**: 
- Implement transfer learning by fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment analysis.
- Create a web application to deploy the ONNX model for real-time sentiment analysis.

**Project 3: Time Series Forecasting of Stock Prices**  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: Build a model to forecast stock prices using historical data, optimizing the model for performance and interoperability with ONNX.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Yahoo Finance API for historical stock price data. Use the free tier to download stock data for a specific company (e.g., Apple Inc. - AAPL).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Collection**: Use the Yahoo Finance API to gather historical stock price data for the specified company.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create features such as moving averages, volatility, and other technical indicators.
- **Model Selection**: Train a complex model like a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network in TensorFlow/Keras for forecasting.
- **Export to ONNX**: Convert the trained LSTM model to ONNX format for deployment.
- **Cross-Platform Inference**: Load the ONNX model in a different environment (e.g., Scikit-learn) and evaluate its forecasting performance on a validation dataset.
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure forecasting accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

**Bonus Ideas**: 
- Experiment with ensemble methods by combining multiple forecasting models.
- Implement real-time forecasting by integrating the ONNX model with a live stock price feed using the Yahoo Finance API.
