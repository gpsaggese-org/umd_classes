**Description**

In this project, students will utilize TRLX, a library designed for reinforcement learning from human feedback, to train language models based on user preferences. TRLX allows for fine-tuning of models by incorporating feedback mechanisms, enabling the development of more aligned and user-centric outputs. The goal is to enhance the interaction quality of language models through effective learning from human feedback.

Technologies Used
TRLX

- Facilitates reinforcement learning from human feedback to improve model generation.
- Supports various pre-trained models and allows for fine-tuning based on user preferences.
- Provides a flexible framework for designing reward functions based on user interactions.

### Project 1: Fine-Tuning a Chatbot for Customer Support
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: The goal is to fine-tune a pre-trained language model to act as a customer support chatbot that can effectively respond to user queries based on historical customer interaction data.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Customer Support on Twitter" dataset available on Kaggle, which contains tweets and responses from customer service interactions.

**Tasks**:
- **Preprocessing Data**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to extract relevant queries and responses.
- **Define Reward Function**: Create a reward function based on user satisfaction metrics (e.g., response accuracy, helpfulness).
- **Fine-Tune Model**: Use TRLX to fine-tune a pre-trained language model with the cleaned dataset and defined reward function.
- **Evaluate Performance**: Test the chatbot's responses against a validation set and measure performance based on user satisfaction.
- **Deployment**: Set up a simple interface to interact with the chatbot and gather user feedback for further improvement.

### Project 2: Personalized Content Recommendation System
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)

**Project Objective**: Build a content recommendation system that learns from user feedback to suggest articles based on individual preferences and reading history.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "News Articles for Recommendation" dataset from Kaggle, which includes user interactions with various articles.

**Tasks**:
- **Data Exploration**: Analyze user interaction data to understand preferences and reading patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create user and article embeddings based on interactions to represent preferences effectively.
- **Define Reward Function**: Develop a reward function that captures user engagement metrics (e.g., clicks, reading time).
- **Train Recommendation Model**: Utilize TRLX to train a recommendation model that adapts to user feedback and improves over time.
- **User Testing**: Conduct user testing sessions to evaluate the effectiveness of recommendations and gather qualitative feedback.

**Bonus Ideas**: Implement collaborative filtering techniques alongside TRLX for hybrid recommendations, or integrate real-time user feedback mechanisms for continuous learning.

### Project 3: Interactive Story Generation with User Feedback
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: Create an interactive storytelling application where users can provide feedback on story elements, allowing the model to generate personalized narratives based on user preferences.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "WritingPrompts" dataset from Kaggle, which contains various prompts and stories generated by users.

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to extract story elements and user feedback.
- **User Interface Development**: Build a user-friendly interface for users to input preferences and provide feedback on generated story segments.
- **Define Complex Reward Function**: Design a reward function that considers various aspects of storytelling, such as coherence, creativity, and user engagement.
- **Train Story Generation Model**: Employ TRLX to train a language model that generates stories based on user feedback and preferences.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Implement a feedback loop where user interactions continuously improve story generation quality.

**Bonus Ideas**: Experiment with different narrative styles or genres based on user preferences, or integrate sentiment analysis to enhance emotional resonance in stories.
