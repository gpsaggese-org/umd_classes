**Description**

In this project, students will utilize spaCy, an advanced natural language processing (NLP) library in Python, to analyze and extract insights from textual data. spaCy offers pre-trained models for various languages, efficient tokenization, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing, allowing for robust text analysis workflows.

Technologies Used
spaCy

- Provides pre-trained models for various languages, optimized for speed and efficiency.
- Supports advanced NLP tasks such as named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing.
- Allows easy integration with other libraries for visualization and deeper analysis.

### Project 1: Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: 
Analyze sentiment in movie reviews to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral, optimizing for accuracy in sentiment classification.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "IMDb Movie Reviews" dataset available on Kaggle: [IMDb Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Ingestion**: Load the IMDb dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and tokenize reviews using spaCy's tokenization capabilities.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Use spaCy’s built-in text classification capabilities to train a model on labeled sentiment data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the distribution of sentiments using Matplotlib or Seaborn.

### Project 2: Named Entity Recognition in News Articles
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)

**Project Objective**: 
Implement a named entity recognition (NER) system to extract and categorize entities from a set of news articles, optimizing for the accuracy of entity recognition.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "News Articles" dataset available on Kaggle: [News Articles](https://www.kaggle.com/sbhatti/news-articles).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Collection**: Download and load the dataset of news articles into a DataFrame.
- **Entity Recognition Setup**: Utilize spaCy’s pre-trained NER model to identify entities in the text.
- **Custom Entity Training**: Fine-tune the NER model with additional labeled data if necessary, focusing on specific entity types (e.g., organizations, locations).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess the model's performance using F1-score and confusion matrix.
- **Visualization**: Create visual representations of the most frequently recognized entities using word clouds or bar charts.

### Project 3: Topic Modeling on Academic Papers
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: 
Develop a topic modeling pipeline to identify prevalent themes in a collection of academic papers, optimizing for coherence and interpretability of topics.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "ArXiv Academic Papers" dataset available on Kaggle: [ArXiv Papers](https://www.kaggle.com/CornellUniv/arxiv).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Ingestion**: Load the dataset of academic papers into a structured format.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text using spaCy for tokenization and lemmatization.
- **Topic Modeling**: Implement Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for topic modeling using the processed text data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the coherence of topics using metrics such as UMass or Coherence Score.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the topics and their distributions across documents using pyLDAvis or similar libraries.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- For Project 1, explore multi-class classification by introducing more sentiment categories.
- For Project 2, implement a comparison of performance between spaCy's pre-trained model and a custom-trained model on a specific domain.
- For Project 3, consider implementing a dynamic topic modeling approach to track how topics evolve over time in the dataset.
