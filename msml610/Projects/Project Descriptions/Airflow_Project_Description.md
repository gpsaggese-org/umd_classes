**Description**

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It allows users to define complex data pipelines with ease and provides a rich user interface to visualize the workflow. Key features include:

- **Dynamic Pipeline Generation**: Create workflows that can adapt based on external conditions.
- **Extensible**: Integrate with various data sources and services through custom operators.
- **Robust Scheduling**: Schedule tasks using a variety of intervals and triggers.
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring and logging of workflow execution.

### Project 1: Data Ingestion and Preprocessing Pipeline (Difficulty: 1 - Easy)

**Project Objective**: Build a data ingestion and preprocessing pipeline that collects data from a public API, cleans the data, and stores it in a structured format for analysis.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the OpenWeatherMap API (free tier) to collect weather data. 

**Tasks**:
- **Set Up Airflow Environment**: Install Airflow and configure a local or cloud-based instance.
- **Create API Ingestion Task**: Write a Python operator to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and store it in a temporary staging area (e.g., CSV file).
- **Data Cleaning Task**: Implement a task to clean the data (handle missing values, outliers) using Pandas.
- **Store Processed Data**: Write a task to save the cleaned data into a structured format (e.g., SQL database or CSV).
- **Schedule and Monitor**: Schedule the workflow to run daily and monitor its execution through the Airflow UI.

### Project 2: Predictive Maintenance Pipeline (Difficulty: 2 - Medium)

**Project Objective**: Develop a data pipeline that ingests IoT sensor data, performs feature engineering, and trains a predictive maintenance model to forecast equipment failure.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set available on Kaggle.

**Tasks**:
- **Set Up Airflow with DAGs**: Create a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to represent the workflow.
- **Data Ingestion Task**: Implement a task to download and ingest the sensor data from Kaggle into a storage system (e.g., AWS S3).
- **Feature Engineering Task**: Write a task to create new features from the raw sensor data (e.g., rolling averages, time-based features).
- **Model Training Task**: Use a machine learning library (e.g., Scikit-learn) to train a predictive model (e.g., Random Forest) on the processed data.
- **Evaluation and Logging**: Implement a task to evaluate model performance and log results for monitoring.

### Project 3: Real-Time Data Processing and Anomaly Detection (Difficulty: 3 - Hard)

**Project Objective**: Create an end-to-end data pipeline that ingests streaming data, performs real-time anomaly detection, and triggers alerts based on detected anomalies.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the Twitter API (free tier) to stream tweets related to a specific topic (e.g., "cryptocurrency").

**Tasks**:
- **Set Up Streaming Data Ingestion**: Create an Airflow task to set up a connection to the Twitter API and stream tweets in real-time.
- **Data Storage Task**: Implement a task to store incoming tweets in a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) for further processing.
- **Anomaly Detection Task**: Develop a task that uses a statistical method (e.g., Z-score) or machine learning model (e.g., Isolation Forest) to detect anomalies in tweet sentiment scores.
- **Alerting Mechanism**: Create a task that sends alerts (e.g., email or SMS) when anomalies are detected.
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Integrate a visualization tool (e.g., Grafana) to display real-time metrics and anomalies.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: 
- For Project 1, extend the pipeline to include data visualization tasks using Matplotlib or Seaborn.
- For Project 2, compare the performance of different machine learning models and implement hyperparameter tuning.
- For Project 3, explore advanced anomaly detection techniques like LSTM-based approaches for time-series data.
