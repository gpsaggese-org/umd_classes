### Project 3: Time Series Forecasting of Stock Prices (Difficulty: 3 - Hard)

**Project Objective:**  
Build a time series forecasting model to predict future stock prices using historical data, optimizing for accuracy and computational efficiency.

**Dataset Suggestions:**  
- Use the "Stock Prices" dataset from Yahoo Finance via the yfinance library, which provides historical stock price data: [Yahoo Finance API](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/).

**Tasks:**
- Data Acquisition:
  - Fetch historical stock prices using yfinance and preprocess the data for analysis.
- Feature Engineering:
  - Create additional features such as moving averages and volatility metrics.
- Model Development:
  - Implement a recurrent neural network (RNN) for forecasting, leveraging Accelerate for efficient training.
- Hyperparameter Tuning:
  - Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
- Evaluation:
  - Evaluate the model using metrics such as MAE and visualize predictions against actual stock prices.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional):**
- For Project 1: Compare the performance of multiple regression algorithms (e.g., Lasso, Ridge) alongside the linear model.
- For Project 2: Experiment with data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
- For Project 3: Integrate sentiment analysis of financial news to enhance forecasting accuracy.
