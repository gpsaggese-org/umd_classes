### Project 1: Predictive Maintenance in Manufacturing (Difficulty: 1)

**Project Objective**  
Develop a predictive maintenance model to forecast equipment failures in a manufacturing setting, optimizing maintenance schedules and reducing downtime.

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- **Dataset**: NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set  
- **Source**: Available on Kaggle [NASA Turbofan Engine Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behnamf/engine-degradation-simulation-dataset)

**Tasks**  
- **Data Ingestion**: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and perform initial exploration.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and create relevant features for modeling.  
- **Model Development**: Train a classification model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict failure events.  
- **Experiment Tracking**: Use W&B Weave to log model parameters, metrics, and evaluation results.  
- **Visualization**: Create visualizations in W&B Weave to analyze model performance and feature importance.  

### Project 2: Customer Segmentation Analysis (Difficulty: 2)

**Project Objective**  
Perform customer segmentation on e-commerce data to identify distinct customer groups and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- **Dataset**: Online Retail Dataset  
- **Source**: Available on UCI Machine Learning Repository [Online Retail](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)

**Tasks**  
- **Data Loading**: Import the dataset and examine the structure and contents.  
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates and handle missing values; perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- **Feature Engineering**: Create features such as purchase frequency, average order value, and recency.  
- **Clustering**: Apply K-Means clustering to segment customers based on engineered features.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Use W&B Weave to track clustering performance metrics and visualize clusters in 2D space.  
- **Insights Visualization**: Generate and share interactive reports in W&B Weave to present findings to stakeholders.  

### Project 3: Real-Time Sentiment Analysis for Stock Market Prediction (Difficulty: 3)

**Project Objective**  
Build a real-time sentiment analysis pipeline to predict stock price movements based on news sentiment, optimizing trading strategies.

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- **Dataset**: Financial News API (NewsAPI) for news articles and Yahoo Finance API for stock prices.  
- **Source**:  
  - NewsAPI: [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org) (free tier available)  
  - Yahoo Finance: Use `yfinance` library to fetch stock price data.

**Tasks**  
- **API Integration**: Set up connections to NewsAPI and Yahoo Finance to fetch news articles and stock prices.  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Use a pre-trained model (e.g., VADER or TextBlob) to analyze sentiment from news articles.  
- **Data Alignment**: Align sentiment scores with stock price data based on timestamps for analysis.  
- **Model Development**: Train a regression model (e.g., LSTM) to predict stock price movements based on sentiment scores.  
- **Experiment Tracking**: Utilize W&B Weave to log experiments, track metrics, and visualize model performance over time.  
- **Interactive Reporting**: Create a comprehensive report in W&B Weave to communicate findings and trading strategy recommendations.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- For Project 1: Compare model performance with different algorithms (e.g., SVM, Gradient Boosting) and visualize results.  
- For Project 2: Experiment with hierarchical clustering and compare results with K-Means; visualize dendrograms in W&B Weave.  
- For Project 3: Implement a reinforcement learning strategy for trading based on sentiment predictions and visualize trading performance over time.
