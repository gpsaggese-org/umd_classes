**Project 1: Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic**  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**:  
Detect anomalies in network traffic using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to identify unusual patterns that may indicate security threats or breaches.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- UNSW-NB15 Dataset: Available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadami/unsw-nb15) â€” a comprehensive dataset for network intrusion detection.

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis, focusing on relevant features like packet size and protocol type.
  
- Model Training:
    - Build a Hidden Markov Model to capture normal network behavior based on the training data.
  
- Anomaly Detection:
    - Use the trained model to identify deviations from normal patterns in a test dataset.

- Evaluation:
    - Assess the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

- Visualization:
    - Visualize the detected anomalies over time to understand their distribution and characteristics.

**Project 2: Predicting Stock Price Movements**  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)

**Project Objective**:  
Utilize Bayesian Networks to predict stock price movements based on historical price data and external factors such as trading volume and market sentiment.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Yahoo Finance API: Use the free tier to gather historical stock price data for a selected company (e.g., AAPL, MSFT).

**Tasks**:
- Data Collection:
    - Fetch historical stock prices and relevant features (trading volume, market news sentiment) using the Yahoo Finance API.

- Feature Engineering:
    - Create new features that may influence stock price movements, such as moving averages or volatility measures.

- Model Construction:
    - Develop a Bayesian Network to model the relationships between the engineered features and stock price movements.

- Inference and Prediction:
    - Use the network to make predictions about future stock price movements based on the latest data.

- Evaluation:
    - Evaluate model accuracy by comparing predicted movements against actual price changes.

**Project 3: Gene Expression Analysis for Disease Classification**  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**:  
Develop a probabilistic model using Pomegranate to classify gene expression profiles associated with different types of cancer, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA): Access gene expression data for various cancers, available at [GDC Data Portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/).

**Tasks**:
- Data Acquisition:
    - Retrieve gene expression data and corresponding cancer types from the TCGA database.

- Data Preprocessing:
    - Normalize gene expression levels and handle missing values to prepare the dataset for analysis.

- Model Development:
    - Construct a Bayesian Network to model the relationships between gene expressions and cancer types.

- Training and Validation:
    - Train the model on a subset of the data and validate it using cross-validation techniques.

- Performance Metrics:
    - Assess the model's classification performance using confusion matrices and ROC curves.

- Interpretation:
    - Analyze the model to identify key genes that contribute significantly to cancer classification.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Extend the anomaly detection project by incorporating real-time data streaming for live monitoring.
- In the stock prediction project, implement a sentiment analysis component to gauge market sentiment from news articles.
- For the gene expression analysis, explore the integration of additional genomic data types (e.g., methylation or mutation data) to enhance classification accuracy.
