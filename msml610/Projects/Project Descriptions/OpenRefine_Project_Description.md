### Project 1: Data Cleaning for Movie Ratings
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: The goal is to clean and preprocess a messy dataset of movie ratings to prepare it for analysis, ensuring that the data is accurate and consistent for further exploration.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "MovieLens 20M Dataset" available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset).

**Tasks**:
- **Import Data**: Load the MovieLens dataset into OpenRefine.
- **Identify Inconsistencies**: Use faceting to detect duplicates and inconsistencies in movie titles and genres.
- **Data Cleaning**: Apply transformations to standardize genres and titles, removing extraneous characters.
- **Handle Missing Values**: Identify and fill or remove missing rating values appropriately.
- **Export Cleaned Data**: Save the cleaned dataset for further analysis in Python or R.

### Project 2: Enhancing a Public Health Dataset
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)

**Project Objective**: The project aims to enhance a public health dataset by cleaning and enriching it with additional data sources, enabling better analysis of health trends over time.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "CDC COVID-19 Data" available on the CDC website (https://data.cdc.gov/).

**Tasks**:
- **Load Dataset**: Import the CDC COVID-19 dataset into OpenRefine.
- **Standardize Column Names**: Rename columns to ensure consistency and clarity.
- **Data Transformation**: Convert date formats and ensure numerical fields are in the correct format.
- **Data Reconciliation**: Link the dataset with external data (e.g., population data from the U.S. Census Bureau) to enrich the dataset.
- **Quality Assurance**: Use clustering features to identify and correct any remaining inconsistencies in the dataset.

**Bonus Ideas**: Explore temporal trends in COVID-19 cases by merging with historical data or visualizing the impact of population density on case rates.

### Project 3: E-commerce Product Review Analysis
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: The goal is to clean and analyze a large dataset of product reviews from an e-commerce platform, preparing it for sentiment analysis and trend detection.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Amazon Product Reviews" dataset available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews).

**Tasks**:
- **Import Reviews Data**: Load the Amazon product reviews dataset into OpenRefine.
- **Text Cleaning**: Use OpenRefine's text transformation features to standardize text (e.g., removing HTML tags, correcting typos).
- **Sentiment Preparation**: Extract and categorize sentiment scores based on review ratings, creating a new column for sentiment classification.
- **Data Enrichment**: Reconcile product IDs with additional product information (e.g., categories, brands) from a separate dataset.
- **Export for Analysis**: Save the cleaned and enriched dataset for further analysis using machine learning techniques in Python.

**Bonus Ideas**: Implement advanced sentiment analysis using pre-trained models or explore the relationship between review length and sentiment scores.
