**Tool Description: OpenRefine**  
OpenRefine is a powerful tool for working with messy data: cleaning it, transforming it from one format into another, and exploring it. It provides features for data cleaning, transformation, and reconciliation with external datasets. It allows users to perform complex data operations in an intuitive web-based interface.

### Project 1: Exploring and Cleaning Movie Data  
**Difficulty**: 1  
**Project Objective**: The goal is to clean and analyze a dataset of movie ratings to derive insights about user preferences and movie trends.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: MovieLens 20M Dataset  
- **Source**: [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/)  

**Tasks**:  
- Import the MovieLens dataset into OpenRefine for initial exploration.  
- Identify and rectify inconsistencies in movie titles and genres.  
- Remove duplicate entries and handle missing values in user ratings.  
- Create visualizations to analyze trends in user ratings over time using OpenRefine's data export capabilities.  
- Build a simple collaborative filtering recommendation model in Python (using surprise or scikit-learn).

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Compare user ratings by genre and visualize the results.  
- Integrate external datasets, such as IMDb ratings, to enrich the analysis.

### Project 2: Analyzing COVID-19 Vaccination Data  
**Difficulty**: 2  
**Project Objective**: The aim is to clean and analyze COVID-19 vaccination data to identify trends and disparities in vaccination rates across different demographics.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: COVID-19 Vaccination Data (U.S.)  
- **Source**: [Kaggle - COVID-19 Vaccination Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/covid19-vaccination-and-case-trends)  

**Tasks**:  
- Load the vaccination dataset into OpenRefine and perform exploratory data analysis.  
- Clean the dataset by standardizing demographic categories and addressing missing values.  
- Analyze vaccination rates by age group and region, creating summary statistics.  
- Visualize the cleaned data to show disparities in vaccination coverage across different demographics.
- Train a regression model (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) in Python to predict vaccination rates.
- Evaluate model using appropriate metrics.


**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Extend the analysis by comparing vaccination rates with COVID-19 infection rates using external datasets.  
- Explore temporal trends in vaccination rates over time.

### Project 3: Cleaning and Classifying Twitter Sentiment Data  
**Difficulty**: 3  
**Project Objective**: The goal is to clean and prepare a dataset of tweets for sentiment analysis, followed by building a classification model to predict sentiment.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: Sentiment140 Dataset  
- **Source**: [Sentiment140](http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/)  

**Tasks**:  
- Import the Sentiment140 dataset into OpenRefine for initial data exploration and cleaning.  
- Standardize and clean the text data, removing noise such as URLs, special characters, and stop words.  
- Use OpenRefine to create features from the cleaned text, such as word counts or sentiment scores.  
- Train a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT) for sentiment classification using the cleaned dataset and evaluate its performance.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Experiment with different text preprocessing techniques and compare their impact on model performance.  
- Explore the use of different classification models beyond BERT, such as logistic regression or random forests, and compare results.
