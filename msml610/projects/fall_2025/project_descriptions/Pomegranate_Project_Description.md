### Project 1: Predicting Customer Churn (Difficulty: 1)

**Project Objective**:  
The goal is to predict whether a customer will churn (leave) based on their usage patterns, optimizing the model for accuracy.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: "Telco Customer Churn"  
- **Source**: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

**Tasks**:  
- Load and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and categorical variables.  
- Use Pomegranate to create a Hidden Markov Model to capture customer behavior patterns.  
- Train the model and evaluate its performance using accuracy, precision, recall and confusion matrix metrics.  
- Visualize the results to identify key factors influencing churn.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Compare the performance of the Hidden Markov Model with traditional classification models like logistic regression.  
- Implement a feature importance analysis to determine which features most influence churn predictions.

### Project 2: Time Series Forecasting of Stock Prices (Difficulty: 2)

**Project Objective**:  
The aim is to forecast future stock prices using historical data, optimizing for mean absolute error (MAE).

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: "Apple Stock Price Data"  
- **Source**: Yahoo Finance API (free and active)

**Tasks**:  
- Collect and preprocess the historical stock price data, ensuring it is clean and formatted for analysis.  
- Utilize Pomegranateâ€™s Bayesian networks to model the relationships between different stock price features over time.  
- Train the model on historical data and evaluate its forecasting accuracy using MAE and visualizations of predicted vs. actual prices.  
- Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters and validating against a holdout dataset.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Extend the model to include external factors such as market indices or economic indicators.  
- Compare the Bayesian network approach with other time series forecasting methods like ARIMA or LSTM.

### Project 3: Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic (Difficulty: 3)

**Project Objective**:  
The objective is to detect anomalies in network traffic data, optimizing for the precision and recall of the detection system.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: "UNSW-NB15"  
- **Source**: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrwellsdavid/unsw-nb15)

**Tasks**:  
- Load and preprocess the UNSW-NB15 dataset, focusing on feature selection and normalization.  
- Implement a probabilistic model using Pomegranate to identify normal vs. anomalous patterns in network traffic.  
- Train the model on labeled data and evaluate its performance using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.  
- Analyze the results to understand the characteristics of detected anomalies and refine the model as necessary.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Explore ensemble methods to combine multiple models for improved anomaly detection performance.  
- Implement real-time anomaly detection using a streaming data approach with the same dataset to simulate live network traffic.
