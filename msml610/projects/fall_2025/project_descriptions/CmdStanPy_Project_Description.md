**Description**

CmdStanPy is a Python interface for Stan, a powerful probabilistic programming language that allows users to perform Bayesian statistical modeling and data analysis. It provides a simple and efficient way to fit complex models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. CmdStanPy is particularly useful for hierarchical modeling, Bayesian regression, and any analysis requiring probabilistic inference.

Technologies Used
CmdStanPy

- Interfaces with Stan for Bayesian modeling and inference.
- Supports a variety of sampling algorithms, including HMC and NUTS.
- Allows users to define custom models in Stan's modeling language.

**Project 1: Predicting Housing Prices Using Bayesian Regression**  
**Difficulty**: 1

**Project Objective**: The goal is to build a Bayesian regression model to predict housing prices based on various features such as location, size, and number of bedrooms. The project will optimize the model to achieve the best predictive accuracy.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Ames Housing dataset" available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and categorical variables.
- Model Specification:
    - Define a Bayesian linear regression model in Stan to predict housing prices.
- Model Fitting:
    - Use CmdStanPy to fit the model and sample from the posterior distribution.
- Model Evaluation:
    - Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE and compare with a frequentist linear regression model.
- Visualization:
    - Visualize the posterior distributions of the model parameters and predictions.

**Project 2: Hierarchical Modeling of Student Test Scores**  
**Difficulty**: 2

**Project Objective**: The objective is to analyze student test scores across different schools and grades using a hierarchical Bayesian model. The project aims to understand how school-level and student-level factors influence test performance.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) dataset" available on the National Center for Education Statistics (https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/).

**Tasks**:
- Data Preparation:
    - Extract relevant data and preprocess it, focusing on school and student-level variables.
- Hierarchical Model Specification:
    - Create a hierarchical Bayesian model in Stan to account for variability at both the school and student levels.
- Model Fitting:
    - Fit the model using CmdStanPy and interpret the hierarchical structure.
- Posterior Predictive Checks:
    - Conduct posterior predictive checks to validate the model fit.
- Insights and Reporting:
    - Summarize findings and provide insights into factors affecting test scores.

**Project 3: Time Series Forecasting with Bayesian Structural Time Series**  
**Difficulty**: 3

**Project Objective**: This project aims to forecast future sales data using a Bayesian structural time series model. The goal is to capture trends, seasonality, and other patterns in the data, optimizing for the best predictive performance.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Retail Sales Forecasting" dataset available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data).

**Tasks**:
- Data Exploration:
    - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and seasonality in the sales data.
- Model Specification:
    - Define a Bayesian structural time series model in Stan that includes components for trend and seasonality.
- Model Fitting:
    - Fit the model using CmdStanPy and analyze the posterior distributions of the parameters.
- Forecasting:
    - Generate forecasts and calculate prediction intervals for future sales.
- Model Comparison:
    - Compare the Bayesian model's performance against simpler time series models (e.g., ARIMA) using out-of-sample predictions.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- For Project 1, explore the effects of adding interaction terms in the regression model.
- For Project 2, extend the analysis to include a multilevel model with random slopes.
- For Project 3, investigate the impact of external factors (e.g., promotions) on sales through intervention analysis.
