**Description**

Azua is a powerful data science tool designed for automated machine learning (AutoML) and model deployment. It simplifies the process of building, training, and evaluating machine learning models, allowing users to focus on insights rather than intricate coding. Key features include:

- **Automated Data Preprocessing**: Automatically handles missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
- **Model Selection and Tuning**: Evaluates various algorithms and hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
- **Deployment Capabilities**: Facilitates easy deployment of models as REST APIs for real-time predictions.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Provides tools for tracking model performance over time.

### Project 1: Predicting House Prices
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: Build a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset from Kaggle: [House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Ingestion**: Load the dataset into Azua and explore its structure.
- **Preprocessing**: Use Azua's automated preprocessing features to handle missing values and normalize data.
- **Model Training**: Utilize Azua’s model selection capabilities to train multiple regression models.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the models' performance using metrics like RMSE and R².
- **Deployment**: Deploy the best-performing model as a REST API for real-time price predictions.

**Bonus Ideas**: 
- Compare the performance of different regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression vs. Random Forest).
- Create a simple web interface to input house details and receive price predictions.

### Project 2: Customer Segmentation for E-commerce
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)

**Project Objective**: Segment customers based on purchasing behavior to tailor marketing strategies.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Online Retail" dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preparation**: Import the dataset into Azua and clean the data by removing duplicates and irrelevant entries.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create features such as total spending per customer and frequency of purchases.
- **Clustering**: Apply Azua’s clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to identify distinct customer segments.
- **Visualization**: Use Azua's visualization tools to present the clusters and their characteristics.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the clustering model to allow marketers to input new customer data for segmentation.

**Bonus Ideas**: 
- Investigate the impact of seasonal trends on customer segments.
- Integrate external data (like demographics) to enhance segmentation.

### Project 3: Real-time Sentiment Analysis on Social Media
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: Develop a model to analyze and predict sentiment from real-time social media posts related to a specific topic.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Utilize the Twitter API (free tier) to stream tweets in real-time based on specific hashtags or keywords.

**Tasks**:
- **API Setup**: Set up the Twitter API to collect real-time tweets related to a chosen topic (e.g., climate change).
- **Data Preprocessing**: Use Azua to clean and preprocess the text data, including tokenization and removing stop words.
- **Sentiment Analysis Model**: Train a sentiment analysis model using Azua’s AutoML features on a labeled dataset (e.g., Sentiment140).
- **Real-time Prediction**: Implement a pipeline to classify incoming tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the sentiment analysis model as an API to provide real-time sentiment scores for new tweets.

**Bonus Ideas**: 
- Create visual dashboards to display sentiment trends over time.
- Compare the sentiment of tweets across different topics or events.
