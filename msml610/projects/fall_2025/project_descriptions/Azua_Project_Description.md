## Description  
Azua is a powerful data science tool designed for automated machine learning (AutoML) and model deployment. It simplifies the process of building, training, and evaluating machine learning models, allowing users to focus on insights rather than intricate coding. Key features include:  

- **Automated Data Preprocessing**: Automatically handles missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.  
- **Model Selection and Tuning**: Evaluates various algorithms and hyperparameters to optimize model performance.  
- **Deployment Capabilities**: Facilitates easy deployment of models as REST APIs for real-time predictions.  
- **Performance Monitoring**: Provides tools for tracking model performance over time.

### Project 1: Predicting House Prices  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  

**Project Objective**:  
Build a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: Melbourne Housing Market Dataset  
- **Link**: [Melbourne Housing Market (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Ingestion**: Load the dataset into Azua and explore its structure.  
- **Preprocessing**: Use Azua's automated preprocessing features to handle missing values and normalize data.  
- **Model Training**: Utilize Azua’s model selection capabilities to train multiple regression models.  
- **Evaluation**: Assess the models' performance using metrics like RMSE and R².  
- **Deployment**: Deploy the best-performing model as a REST API for real-time price predictions.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Compare the performance of different regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression vs. Random Forest).  
- Create a simple web interface to input house details and receive price predictions.

### Project 2: Customer Segmentation for E-commerce  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  

**Project Objective**:  
Segment customers based on purchasing behavior to tailor marketing strategies.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: E-Commerce Data (Retail Transactions)  
- **Link**: [E-Commerce Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Preparation**: Import the dataset into Azua and clean the data by removing duplicates and irrelevant entries.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Create features such as total spending per customer and frequency of purchases.  
- **Clustering**: Apply Azua’s clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to identify distinct customer segments.  
- **Visualization**: Use Azua's visualization tools to present the clusters and their characteristics.  
- **Deployment**: Deploy the clustering model to allow marketers to input new customer data for segmentation.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Investigate the impact of seasonal trends on customer segments.  
- Integrate external data (like demographics) to enhance segmentation.

### Project 3: Real-time Sentiment Analysis on Social Media  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  

**Project Objective**:  
Develop and compare multiple sentiment analysis models that can process and classify social media text in real-time simulations, predicting whether a post is positive, negative, or neutral.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Training Dataset**: Sentiment140 Dataset (1.6M labeled tweets)  
  - [Sentiment140 (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)  
- **Streaming Simulation Dataset**: Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset  
  - [Twitter Sentiment (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arkhoshghalb/twitter-sentiment-analysis-hatred-speech)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Clean and normalize text (lowercasing, removing stopwords, tokenization).  
  - Convert text into embeddings (e.g., TF-IDF vectors, word2vec, or BERT embeddings).  

- **Model Training (Multiple Approaches)**:  
  - **Classical ML**: Train baseline models like Logistic Regression or SVM on TF-IDF features.  
  - **Deep Learning**: Use pretrained embeddings (e.g., GloVe, BERT) with simple neural networks.  
  - **Azua AutoML**: Apply Azua’s AutoML engine to automatically select and optimize the best sentiment model.  

- **Streaming Simulation**:  
  - Simulate “real-time” by feeding batches of tweets from the streaming dataset.  
  - Compare performance and latency of each model.  

- **Evaluation**:  
  - Compare models using metrics like Accuracy, F1-score, and inference time.  
  - Visualize confusion matrices and sentiment distribution.  

- **Deployment**:  
  - Deploy the best-performing model as a REST API.  
  - Optional: deploy multiple models and use an ensemble or majority vote system.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Build a **dashboard** that compares real-time predictions from multiple models side by side.  
- Implement **model drift monitoring** to check if the sentiment distribution changes over time.  
- Use **ensembling** to combine predictions from classical ML, deep learning, and AutoML.
