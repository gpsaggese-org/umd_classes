**Tool Description: trlx**

trlx is a powerful library designed for fine-tuning transformer-based models for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). It simplifies the process of training language models to align better with human preferences through interactive feedback mechanisms. 

- **Features:**
  - Easy integration with popular transformer models.
  - Support for reinforcement learning techniques to optimize model outputs.
  - User-friendly API for quick experimentation.
  - Built-in evaluation metrics to assess model performance.

### Project 1: Sentiment Analysis with Human Feedback
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: Develop a sentiment analysis model that predicts the sentiment of product reviews, optimizing for accuracy based on human feedback.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the Amazon Product Reviews dataset available on Kaggle: [Amazon Product Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text data, including tokenization and removal of stopwords.
- **Model Selection**: Use a pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face's Transformers library for initial sentiment classification.
- **Fine-tuning**: Implement trlx to fine-tune the model using human feedback on sentiment predictions.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: Compare model performance with traditional machine learning classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM) on the same dataset.

### Project 2: Personalized News Recommendation System
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: Create a personalized news recommendation system that suggests articles based on user preferences, optimizing for user engagement metrics.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the News Articles dataset from Kaggle: [News Articles](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snapcrack/all-the-news).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Exploration**: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand article features and user interactions.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract features from articles (e.g., TF-IDF, embeddings) and user profiles (e.g., reading history).
- **Model Development**: Implement a collaborative filtering approach using embeddings and fine-tune with trlx based on user feedback.
- **Evaluation**: Measure the recommendation accuracy using metrics such as Mean Average Precision (MAP) and user engagement rates.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: Experiment with different feedback mechanisms, such as thumbs up/down or star ratings, to evaluate their impact on recommendation quality.

### Project 3: Automated Text Summarization with Feedback Loop
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: Build an automated text summarization model that generates concise summaries of long articles, optimizing for coherence and relevance based on user feedback.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the CNN/Daily Mail dataset available on Hugging Face Datasets: [CNN/Daily Mail](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preparation**: Preprocess the dataset to extract articles and their corresponding summaries.
- **Model Selection**: Start with a pre-trained T5 model for text summarization from Hugging Face.
- **Fine-tuning with trlx**: Implement trlx to refine the summarization model using human feedback on generated summaries.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the summaries using ROUGE scores and conduct qualitative assessments based on user feedback.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: Explore multi-document summarization and compare the performance of different summarization models (e.g., BART, T5) in generating coherent summaries.
