**Description**

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data. It allows clients to request exactly the data they need, making it efficient for data retrieval. Key features include:

- **Flexible Queries**: Clients can specify exactly what data they need, reducing over-fetching.
- **Single Endpoint**: Unlike REST, GraphQL uses a single endpoint for all requests, simplifying API management.
- **Strongly Typed Schema**: GraphQL APIs are defined by a schema that specifies the types of data and relationships, ensuring data integrity.

### Project 1: Movie Recommendation System
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: Develop a movie recommendation system that predicts user preferences based on historical ratings and user profiles.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the [MovieLens 100K dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/) from GroupLens, which contains user ratings for movies. 

**Tasks**:
- **Set Up GraphQL API**: Create a GraphQL API to serve movie and user data.
- **Data Ingestion**: Load the MovieLens dataset into a database and expose it via the GraphQL API.
- **User Profile Creation**: Implement a method to collect user ratings and generate profiles.
- **Recommendation Algorithm**: Use collaborative filtering to recommend movies based on user profiles.
- **Evaluation**: Measure recommendation accuracy using metrics like RMSE or precision/recall.

**Bonus Ideas**: Experiment with hybrid recommendation techniques by incorporating content-based filtering. Visualize user preferences with dashboards.

### Project 2: Real-Time COVID-19 Data Dashboard
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)

**Project Objective**: Build a real-time dashboard that displays COVID-19 statistics and trends using data from multiple sources.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Utilize the [COVID-19 Open Data](https://covid19data.com/) from Google Cloud, which is available via a public API.

**Tasks**:
- **GraphQL API Setup**: Develop a GraphQL API to aggregate COVID-19 data from various sources.
- **Data Retrieval**: Write queries to fetch data on cases, vaccinations, and demographics.
- **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Create an interactive dashboard using a visualization library (e.g., Plotly or D3.js) to display trends.
- **User Interaction**: Allow users to filter data by location, date, and type of statistic.

**Bonus Ideas**: Incorporate predictive modeling to forecast future cases using time series analysis. Add features to compare statistics between different countries or regions.

### Project 3: E-commerce Sales Forecasting
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: Create a predictive model to forecast sales for an e-commerce platform based on historical sales data and external factors.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the [Retail Sales Forecasting dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data) from Kaggle, which includes sales data for various products.

**Tasks**:
- **GraphQL API Development**: Build a GraphQL API to serve sales data and external factors (e.g., promotions, seasonality).
- **Data Integration**: Combine historical sales data with external datasets (like holidays or economic indicators) through GraphQL queries.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features such as rolling averages, seasonal trends, and promotional impacts.
- **Model Training**: Implement machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost or ARIMA) to predict future sales.
- **Evaluation and Visualization**: Assess model performance using metrics like MAP or MAPE and visualize forecast results.

**Bonus Ideas**: Explore advanced techniques like ensemble modeling or deep learning for time series forecasting. Implement a feedback loop to refine model predictions based on real-time sales data.
