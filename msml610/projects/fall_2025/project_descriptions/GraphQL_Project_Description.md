## Description  
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data. It allows clients to request exactly the data they need, making it efficient for data retrieval. Key features include:  

- **Flexible Queries**: Clients can specify exactly what data they need, reducing over-fetching.  
- **Single Endpoint**: Unlike REST, GraphQL uses a single endpoint for all requests, simplifying API management.  
- **Strongly Typed Schema**: GraphQL APIs are defined by a schema that specifies the types of data and relationships, ensuring data integrity.

### Project 1: Movie Recommendation System  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  

**Project Objective**:  
Develop a movie recommendation system that predicts user preferences based on historical ratings and user profiles, and serve results via a GraphQL API.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: MovieLens 25M (Kaggle)  
- **Link**: [MovieLens 25M (Kaggle)](hhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/garymk/movielens-25m-dataset)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Set Up GraphQL API**: Create a GraphQL API to serve movie and user data.  
- **Data Ingestion**: Load MovieLens ratings and metadata into a database.  
- **User Profile Creation**: Generate user profiles based on rating histories.  
- **Recommendation Algorithm**: Implement collaborative filtering (e.g., matrix factorization or nearest neighbors).  
- **Evaluation**: Measure recommendation quality with RMSE, precision, and recall.  
- **GraphQL Integration**: Serve personalized recommendations through GraphQL queries.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Incorporate content-based filtering using movie genres.  
- Build a dashboard to visualize recommendations and user activity.

### Project 2: COVID-19 Trends and Forecasting Dashboard  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  

**Project Objective**:  
Build an interactive dashboard that visualizes COVID-19 cases and vaccinations across countries and includes short-term forecasting of future trends.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: Our World in Data – COVID-19 Dataset  
- **Link**: [COVID-19 Data (Our World in Data)](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases)  

**Tasks**:  
- **GraphQL API Setup**: Define a schema to serve COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations.  
- **Data Ingestion**: Load CSV snapshots into a database and expose via GraphQL.  
- **Query Development**: Enable filtering (e.g., “cases in India between Jan–June 2021”).  
- **Forecasting Model**: Implement a time-series model (Prophet or ARIMA) to predict near-term cases or vaccination uptake.  
- **Visualization**: Build a dashboard (Plotly/Streamlit/D3.js) to show both historical and forecasted values.  
- **Evaluation**: Compare forecasts against actual data using MAE or RMSE.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Compare trajectories between regions (e.g., vaccination vs case rates).  
- Use clustering (e.g., k-means) to group countries by COVID-19 patterns.

### Project 3: E-commerce Sales Forecasting  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  

**Project Objective**:  
Forecast product sales for an e-commerce platform using historical sales data, and expose predictions through a GraphQL API.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: Predict Future Sales (Kaggle Competition Dataset)  
- **Link**: [Retail Sales Forecasting (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data)  

**Tasks**:  
- **GraphQL API Development**: Define a schema to serve product, shop, and sales data.  
- **Data Ingestion**: Load historical sales into a database accessible via GraphQL.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Create features such as rolling averages, seasonality, and product popularity.  
- **Model Training**: Train ML models (XGBoost, Random Forest, or LSTMs) for time-series forecasting.  
- **Evaluation**: Assess performance with MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.  
- **GraphQL Integration**: Query future predictions via GraphQL endpoints.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Add external factors (holidays, promotions) for improved accuracy.  
- Implement ensemble models combining statistical and ML approaches.  
- Create a feedback loop that updates forecasts as new sales data arrives.
