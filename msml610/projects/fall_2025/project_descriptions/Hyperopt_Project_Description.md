### Project 1: Predicting House Prices
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: Build a regression model to predict house prices based on various features like location, size, and number of bedrooms. The goal is to optimize the model's hyperparameters for better accuracy.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset available on Kaggle. 

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing:
  - Clean the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
  
- Feature Selection:
  - Identify and select relevant features that significantly impact house prices using correlation analysis.

- Model Selection:
  - Choose a regression model (e.g., Random Forest Regressor) to predict house prices.

- Hyperparameter Optimization:
  - Utilize Hyperopt to tune hyperparameters like the number of estimators, maximum depth, and minimum samples split.

- Model Evaluation:
  - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².

- Visualization:
  - Visualize the predicted vs. actual house prices using Matplotlib or Seaborn.

### Project 3: Customer Segmentation with E-commerce Data
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: Develop a clustering model to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and optimize the clustering algorithm's hyperparameters for better group differentiation.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Online Retail" dataset available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing:
  - Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and create relevant features (e.g., total purchase amount, frequency of purchases).

- Feature Engineering:
  - Generate features that represent customer behavior, such as Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics.

- Model Selection:
  - Choose a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means or DBSCAN) to segment customers.

- Hyperparameter Optimization:
  - Apply Hyperopt to optimize hyperparameters such as the number of clusters for K-Means or the epsilon and minimum samples for DBSCAN.

- Clustering Evaluation:
  - Evaluate clustering results using silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index.

- Visualization:
  - Visualize customer segments using PCA or t-SNE to reduce dimensionality and plot clusters.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: 
- Explore the impact of additional features (e.g., customer demographics) on segmentation.
- Compare clustering algorithms and their hyperparameter settings to identify the most effective approach.
