**Description**

In this project, students will utilize NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), a powerful Python library for natural language processing, to perform various text analysis tasks. NLTK provides tools for tokenization, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, making it ideal for projects involving text data. Its features include:

- Comprehensive suite of libraries for text processing.
- Easy-to-use interfaces for common NLP tasks like tokenization and stemming.
- Access to a large collection of corpora and lexical resources like WordNet.

### Project 1: Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: The goal is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using sentiment analysis, optimizing for accuracy in predictions.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "IMDb Movie Reviews" dataset available on Kaggle: [IMDb Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Load the dataset, clean text data by removing HTML tags and special characters.
- **Tokenization**: Use NLTK to tokenize the reviews into words.
- **Feature Extraction**: Implement bag-of-words or TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features.
- **Model Training**: Train a simple classification model (e.g., Naive Bayes) on the processed data.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: 
- Compare the performance of different classifiers (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression).
- Visualize the most common words in positive vs. negative reviews using word clouds.

### Project 2: Topic Modeling of News Articles
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)

**Project Objective**: The aim is to identify underlying topics in a collection of news articles, optimizing for coherent topic representation.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "20 Newsgroups" dataset available via the NLTK library directly or on Kaggle: [20 Newsgroups](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/20-newsgroups).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Ingestion**: Load the 20 Newsgroups dataset using NLTK's built-in functions.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text data (remove stop words, stemming).
- **Vectorization**: Convert text data into a document-term matrix using TF-IDF.
- **Topic Modeling**: Implement Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract topics from the text.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the topics using pyLDAvis to interpret and analyze the results.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: 
- Experiment with different numbers of topics and evaluate coherence scores.
- Compare LDA results with Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for topic extraction.

### Project 3: Named Entity Recognition in Scientific Publications
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: The goal is to extract named entities (e.g., authors, institutions, and research topics) from a set of scientific papers, optimizing for recall and precision in entity extraction.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "CORD-19" dataset available on Kaggle: [CORD-19](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Acquisition**: Download and preprocess the CORD-19 dataset.
- **Text Cleaning**: Clean the text by removing unnecessary elements (e.g., references, figures).
- **Tokenization and Tagging**: Use NLTK to tokenize the text and apply part-of-speech tagging.
- **Entity Recognition**: Implement a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model using NLTK or pre-trained models.
- **Evaluation**: Measure the performance of the NER system using standard metrics like F1-score.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: 
- Integrate additional datasets to improve entity recognition performance.
- Explore the use of deep learning models for NER and compare results with traditional methods.
