### Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: The goal is to build a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn from a subscription service, optimizing retention strategies.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Ingestion**: Load the dataset into TFX using the TFX `CsvExampleGen` component.
- **Data Validation**: Implement `SchemaGen` to create a schema for data validation and ensure data quality.
- **Data Transformation**: Utilize `Transform` to preprocess features (e.g., encoding categorical variables).
- **Model Training**: Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Decision Trees) using the `Trainer` component.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance with `Evaluator` to assess metrics like accuracy and F1-score.
- **Model Serving**: Use the `Pusher` component to deploy the trained model for inference.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: Explore hyperparameter tuning using `Tuner` or compare multiple models for performance improvement.

### Project 2: Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: The objective is to develop a sentiment analysis model to classify product reviews as positive or negative, optimizing customer feedback analysis.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Amazon Product Reviews" dataset available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Ingestion**: Utilize `CsvExampleGen` to ingest the product reviews dataset.
- **Data Validation**: Apply `SchemaGen` to define the expected data schema and validate incoming data.
- **Data Transformation**: Employ `Transform` to clean text data (e.g., removing stop words, tokenization) and create embeddings.
- **Model Training**: Create and train a neural network model using the `Trainer` component for binary classification.
- **Model Evaluation**: Implement `Evaluator` to evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
- **Model Serving**: Deploy the trained sentiment analysis model using the `Pusher` component.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: Experiment with different pre-trained embeddings (e.g., BERT) or implement a multi-class classification for sentiment levels.

### Project 3: Predicting House Prices with Feature Engineering
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: The aim is to build a robust model that predicts house prices based on various features, optimizing for accuracy and generalization.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Ingestion**: Ingest the dataset using `CsvExampleGen`.
- **Data Validation**: Implement `SchemaGen` to ensure data integrity and quality checks.
- **Data Transformation**: Use `Transform` to perform feature engineering, including handling missing values, scaling features, and creating interaction terms.
- **Model Training**: Train a regression model (e.g., XGBoost or a deep learning model) using the `Trainer` component.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model with `Evaluator`, focusing on RMSE and RÂ² scores to measure performance.
- **Model Serving**: Deploy the final model using the `Pusher` component for real-time predictions.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: Integrate cross-validation techniques or compare the performance of different regression models, including ensemble methods.
