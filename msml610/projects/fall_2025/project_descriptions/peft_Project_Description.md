**Description**

PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) is a library designed to facilitate the fine-tuning of pre-trained models with minimal computational resources. It allows users to adapt large models to specific tasks without requiring extensive datasets or hardware. Key features include:

- **Parameter-Efficient Techniques**: Reduces the number of trainable parameters, making fine-tuning faster and less resource-intensive.
- **Support for Multiple Architectures**: Compatible with various transformer models, enabling diverse applications in NLP and beyond.
- **Ease of Integration**: Simple API for integrating with existing machine learning workflows and libraries, such as Hugging Face Transformers.
