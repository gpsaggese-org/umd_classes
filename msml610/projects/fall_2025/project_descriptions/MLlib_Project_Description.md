### Project 1: Movie Recommendation System (Difficulty: 1)

**Project Objective**: Create a collaborative filtering-based movie recommendation system that predicts user preferences based on historical ratings.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "MovieLens 100K Dataset" available on Kaggle. 

**Tasks**:
- Data Preparation:
  - Load and preprocess the MovieLens dataset, focusing on user-item interaction.
- Implement Collaborative Filtering:
  - Use MLlib's Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm to build the recommendation model.
- Model Evaluation:
  - Evaluate the recommendation system using metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) on a test set.
- User Interface:
  - Create a simple interface to recommend movies to users based on their previous ratings.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Implement a content-based filtering approach and compare its performance with collaborative filtering.
- Explore hyperparameter tuning for the ALS model to optimize recommendations.

### Project 2: Customer Segmentation (Difficulty: 2)

**Project Objective**: Segment customers based on purchasing behavior using clustering techniques to identify distinct customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Online Retail Dataset" available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

**Tasks**:
- Data Cleaning and Preparation:
  - Clean the dataset by handling missing values and outliers, and extract relevant features for clustering.
- Feature Engineering:
  - Create features such as total purchase amount, frequency of purchases, and recency of last purchase.
- Implement Clustering:
  - Use MLlib's K-means algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups.
- Analyze Clusters:
  - Visualize and interpret the clusters to derive actionable insights for marketing strategies.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Experiment with different clustering algorithms (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models) and compare results.
- Integrate demographic data to enhance the clustering process.

### Project 3: Predictive Maintenance (Difficulty: 3)

**Project Objective**: Build a predictive maintenance model to forecast equipment failures based on sensor data, optimizing maintenance schedules and reducing downtime.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set" available on the NASA Prognostics Data Repository.

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing:
  - Load and preprocess the sensor data, focusing on feature selection and normalization.
- Feature Engineering:
  - Extract relevant features from time-series sensor data to capture trends and anomalies.
- Implement Predictive Modeling:
  - Use MLlib's Random Forest or Gradient-Boosted Trees to predict the time to failure of the equipment.
- Model Evaluation:
  - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score on a test dataset.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Implement a real-time monitoring dashboard using the model predictions for proactive maintenance alerts.
- Explore the integration of unsupervised learning techniques to identify patterns in the sensor data before failures occur.
