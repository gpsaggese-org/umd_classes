**Description**

Dask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytics that enables users to scale their computations across multiple cores or clusters. It integrates seamlessly with NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, making it ideal for handling large datasets and complex computations efficiently. 

Technologies Used
Dask

- Enables parallel computing with minimal changes to existing NumPy and Pandas code.
- Supports out-of-core computation, allowing the processing of datasets larger than memory.
- Provides advanced scheduling capabilities for distributed computing.

### Project 1: Movie Recommendation System (Difficulty: 1 - Easy)

**Project Objective**  
Create a movie recommendation system that predicts user ratings based on collaborative filtering techniques using a large movie dataset. The goal is to optimize recommendations for users based on their historical ratings.

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- Use the "MovieLens 20M Dataset" available on Kaggle: [MovieLens 20M](https://www.kaggle.com/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset).

**Tasks**  
- Load Dataset with Dask:
  - Read the MovieLens dataset into a Dask DataFrame for efficient handling of large data.
  
- Data Preprocessing:
  - Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and format issues.

- Build User-Item Matrix:
  - Create a sparse matrix representing user ratings for movies.

- Implement Collaborative Filtering:
  - Use Dask-ML to implement user-based or item-based collaborative filtering algorithms.

- Generate Recommendations:
  - Predict ratings for unrated movies and recommend top-N movies for each user.

- Evaluate Model Performance:
  - Use metrics such as RMSE or MAE to evaluate the recommendation accuracy.

### Project 2: Large-Scale Twitter Sentiment Analysis (Difficulty: 2 - Medium)

**Project Objective**  
Perform sentiment analysis on a large volume of tweets to detect sentiments towards a specific topic (e.g., climate change). The goal is to analyze trends over time and visualize sentiment distributions.

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- Use the "Sentiment140" dataset available on Kaggle: [Sentiment140](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140).

**Tasks**  
- Load and Explore Dataset:
  - Use Dask to load the dataset and explore its structure and content.

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
  - Clean the tweets (remove URLs, mentions, special characters) and preprocess text for sentiment analysis.

- Sentiment Analysis:
  - Utilize pre-trained models (e.g., VADER or TextBlob) to classify tweet sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.

- Time-Series Analysis:
  - Aggregate sentiment scores over time to analyze trends and visualize results using Dask with Matplotlib.

- Sentiment Visualization:
  - Create visualizations to show how sentiments change over time regarding climate change discussions.

### Project 3: Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment (Difficulty: 3 - Hard)

**Project Objective**  
Develop a predictive maintenance model for industrial equipment using sensor data to forecast failures and optimize maintenance schedules. The goal is to minimize downtime and maintenance costs.

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- Use the "NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set" available on Kaggle: [NASA Turbofan](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behnamf/engine-failure-prediction).

**Tasks**  
- Load Large Datasets:
  - Use Dask to load and manage the large turbine engine dataset efficiently.

- Data Exploration:
  - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between variables and failure events.

- Feature Engineering:
  - Create new features based on sensor readings and historical failure data to enhance predictive modeling.

- Model Development:
  - Implement machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) using Dask-ML to predict failures.

- Model Evaluation:
  - Evaluate the model using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1 score to understand its predictive capabilities.

- Deployment Consideration:
  - Discuss how to integrate the model into a real-time monitoring system for predictive maintenance.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Experiment with ensemble methods or deep learning models for improved accuracy.
- Implement a dashboard using Dash or Streamlit to visualize predictions and maintenance schedules.
