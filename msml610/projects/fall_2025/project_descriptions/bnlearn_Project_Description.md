**Description**

In this project, students will utilize bnlearn, a Python library for Bayesian network learning, to build and analyze probabilistic graphical models. This tool allows users to infer relationships among variables and make predictions based on observed data. It provides functionalities for structure learning, parameter estimation, and inference, making it suitable for various applications in data science.

Technologies Used
bnlearn

- Facilitates the creation, learning, and inference of Bayesian networks.
- Supports both constraint-based and score-based structure learning methods.
- Allows for parameter estimation using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Bayesian methods.
- Provides tools for performing inference queries on the learned networks.
