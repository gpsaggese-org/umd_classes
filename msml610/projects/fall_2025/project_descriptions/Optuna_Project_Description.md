### Project 3: Customer Segmentation Using Clustering (Difficulty: 3 - Hard)

**Project Objective**: Apply unsupervised learning to segment customers based on purchasing behavior, optimizing clustering parameters with Optuna.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Online Retail" dataset available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

**Tasks**:
- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess the dataset by removing duplicates and handling missing values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create relevant features such as total purchase amount and frequency of purchases.
- **Model Selection**: Choose a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN).
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Use Optuna to optimize parameters such as the number of clusters, epsilon (for DBSCAN), and min_samples.
- **Cluster Evaluation**: Evaluate clustering performance using silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the clusters in 2D or 3D space to identify distinct customer segments.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- For Project 1, compare the performance of different regression algorithms after hyperparameter tuning.
- For Project 2, explore transfer learning with pre-trained models and compare with the optimized model.
- For Project 3, implement additional clustering algorithms and compare their results with the optimized one.
