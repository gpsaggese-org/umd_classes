### Project 1: Text Generation with GPT-2  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  

**Project Objective**  
Fine-tune a GPT-2 model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt. The focus is on optimizing performance while minimizing training time and resource usage with DeepSpeed.  

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- [WikiText-2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikitext) or [BookCorpus Open](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bookcorpusopen) (both lightweight, widely used for text modeling).  

**Tasks**  
- **Set Up DeepSpeed**: Install and configure DeepSpeed in Colab.  
- **Fine-tune GPT-2**: Load GPT-2 via Hugging Face Transformers and fine-tune on the dataset.  
- **DeepSpeed Optimization**: Use mixed precision training and memory optimizations.  
- **Evaluate**: Measure perplexity and sample generated text for qualitative evaluation.  
- **Visualization**: Plot loss curves to assess training efficiency.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Try different GPT-2 sizes (small vs medium).  
- Compare standard vs DeepSpeed training runtime.

### Project 2: Image Classification with EfficientNet  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  

**Project Objective**  
Train an EfficientNet model on CIFAR-10, optimizing for accuracy and training efficiency using DeepSpeed.  

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- [CIFAR-10](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cifar10) (via Hugging Face) or `torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10`.  

**Tasks**  
- **Data Prep**: Normalize, augment images.  
- **Model Setup**: Implement EfficientNet (PyTorch/TensorFlow).  
- **Integrate DeepSpeed**: Use mixed precision + gradient checkpointing for efficient training.  
- **Training**: Train EfficientNet, log metrics.  
- **Evaluation**: Report accuracy and confusion matrix.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Try different EfficientNet variants (B0 vs B2).  
- Compare DeepSpeed training vs standard training runtime.

### Project 3: Large-Scale Text Classification with BERT  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard) 

**Project Objective**  
Build a sentiment classification model on tweets using BERT with DeepSpeed optimizations. The goal is to handle large-scale text efficiently.  

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- [Sentiment140](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140) on Kaggle (1.6M labeled tweets).  

**Tasks**  
- **Data Prep**: Clean and tokenize tweets.  
- **Model Setup**: Start with DistilBERT as a baseline, then scale to BERT if possible.  
- **DeepSpeed Integration**: Use gradient accumulation + model parallelism.  
- **Training**: Train and validate model, monitor metrics.  
- **Evaluation**: Report precision, recall, F1, and confusion matrix.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Compare DistilBERT, BERT, and RoBERTa performance.  
- Experiment with class imbalance handling (oversampling, class weights).
