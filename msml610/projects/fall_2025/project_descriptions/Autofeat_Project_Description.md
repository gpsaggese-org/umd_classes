**Description**

Autofeat is a Python library designed to automate the feature engineering process by generating new features from existing ones, optimizing their selection based on model performance. It helps data scientists enhance their models by automatically identifying relevant features, thus streamlining the modeling pipeline.

### Project 1: Predicting House Prices
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: Build a regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. The goal is to optimize the feature set to improve prediction accuracy.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Ames Housing Dataset" available on Kaggle ([Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prestonvong/austin-housing-data)).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Feature Generation with Autofeat**: Utilize Autofeat to automatically create and select new features from the existing dataset.
- **Model Training**: Train a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression) using the original and newly generated features.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².

**Bonus Ideas**: 
- Experiment with different regression models (e.g., Ridge, Lasso) and compare their performance.
- Visualize feature importance to understand which features contribute most to the predictions.

### Project 2: Customer Churn Prediction
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)

**Project Objective**: Develop a classification model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company, aiming to identify at-risk customers based on their usage patterns and demographics.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset available on Kaggle ([Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Exploration**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior and identify potential churn indicators.
- **Feature Engineering with Autofeat**: Apply Autofeat to generate new features that may better capture customer behavior and improve the model.
- **Model Development**: Train a classification model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict churn, using both original and generated features.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use confusion matrix and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

**Bonus Ideas**: 
- Implement a cost-sensitive model to account for the business impact of false positives and false negatives.
- Create a dashboard to visualize customer segments and churn predictions.

### Project 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: Build an anomaly detection model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions, optimizing the feature set to enhance detection performance in an imbalanced dataset.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset available on Kaggle ([Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dalpozz/creditcard-fraud)).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE and perform data normalization.
- **Feature Engineering with Autofeat**: Utilize Autofeat to generate features that can help distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
- **Anomaly Detection Model**: Train an anomaly detection model (e.g., Isolation Forest or Autoencoder) on the processed dataset.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.

**Bonus Ideas**: 
- Implement real-time monitoring of transactions with a scoring system based on model predictions.
- Explore the impact of different feature generation strategies on model performance.
