**Description**

HMMlearn is a Python library designed for Hidden Markov Models (HMM), which are statistical models that assume an underlying process generating observable events is a Markov process with unobserved (hidden) states. It is particularly useful for sequential data analysis and time-series prediction. 

Technologies Used
HMMlearn

- Provides implementations of various HMM algorithms, including Gaussian HMMs and Multinomial HMMs.
- Supports training, evaluation, and prediction on sequences of data.
- Offers functionality for model fitting and state inference.

### Project 1: Stock Price Movement Prediction (Difficulty: 1 - Easy)

**Project Objective**: The goal is to predict future movements in stock prices based on historical data using a Hidden Markov Model. Students will focus on classifying stock price movements as "up," "down," or "stable."

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Daily Historical Stock Prices" dataset available on Kaggle (e.g., "Stock Prices Dataset").
- Alternatively, fetch historical stock prices using the Alpha Vantage API (free tier).

**Tasks**:
- Data Collection:
    - Gather historical stock price data and preprocess it for analysis.
  
- Feature Engineering:
    - Create features such as daily returns, volatility, and moving averages.
  
- Model Training:
    - Implement a Gaussian HMM using HMMlearn to model the stock price movements.
  
- Prediction:
    - Use the trained model to predict future stock price movements and evaluate accuracy.
  
- Visualization:
    - Visualize predicted movements against actual stock prices using Matplotlib.

### Project 2: Speech Recognition using HMM (Difficulty: 2 - Medium)

**Project Objective**: Develop a speech recognition system that can classify spoken digits (0-9) using a Hidden Markov Model. The project will involve processing audio signals and extracting features for classification.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Free Spoken Digit Dataset" available on GitHub.
- Alternatively, explore the "Google Speech Commands" dataset on Kaggle.

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Load audio files and convert them into a suitable format (e.g., MFCC features).
  
- Feature Extraction:
    - Extract Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) from audio signals for each digit.
  
- Model Training:
    - Train a Multinomial HMM using HMMlearn on the extracted features.
  
- Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the model's performance using confusion matrices and accuracy metrics.
  
- Deployment:
    - Create a simple user interface to input audio and display predicted digit.

### Project 3: Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic (Difficulty: 3 - Hard)

**Project Objective**: Build an anomaly detection system for network traffic data using a Hidden Markov Model. The aim is to identify unusual patterns that may indicate security threats or breaches.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "UNSW-NB15" dataset available on Kaggle.
- Alternatively, utilize the "CICIDS 2017" dataset, which is also available on Kaggle.

**Tasks**:
- Data Preparation:
    - Preprocess the network traffic data, handling missing values and normalizing features.
  
- Feature Engineering:
    - Create time-series features such as packet counts, bytes transferred, and connection durations.
  
- Model Training:
    - Implement a Gaussian HMM using HMMlearn to model normal network behavior.
  
- Anomaly Detection:
    - Use the trained model to detect anomalies in live or historical network traffic data.
  
- Evaluation:
    - Assess the performance of the anomaly detection system using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
  
- Visualization:
    - Visualize detected anomalies and normal traffic patterns using Seaborn or Matplotlib.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: 
- For Project 1, compare HMM predictions with other machine learning models like Random Forest or LSTM.
- For Project 2, extend the model to recognize phrases instead of single digits.
- For Project 3, implement a feedback loop that retrains the model based on new traffic data to improve accuracy over time.
