**Tool Description: TorchRL**  
TorchRL is a library built on PyTorch that simplifies the implementation of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. It provides a flexible and modular framework for training RL agents across various environments. Key features include:

- Support for various RL algorithms (DQN, PPO, A3C, etc.)
- Integration with OpenAI Gym for diverse environment simulations
- Utilities for policy evaluation, training, and logging
- Pre-trained models for quick experimentation and benchmarking
