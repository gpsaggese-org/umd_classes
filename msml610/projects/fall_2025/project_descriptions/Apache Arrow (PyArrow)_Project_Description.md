## Description  
Apache Arrow (PyArrow) is a cross-language development platform for in-memory data that provides a standardized columnar memory format to accelerate data processing. It enables efficient data interchange between different data processing systems and languages.  

**Features** 
  - Provides high-performance, columnar data representation.  
  - Supports zero-copy reads for efficient data access.  
  - Facilitates interoperability between different data processing frameworks like Pandas, Dask, and Spark.

### Project 1: Airbnb Price Prediction with Efficient Data Pipelines  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  

**Project Objective**:  
Predict nightly Airbnb rental prices using PyArrow to efficiently handle and process structured tabular data. The project emphasizes building a memory-efficient data pipeline while improving regression model performance.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: New York City Airbnb Open Data  
- **Link**: [NYC Airbnb Open Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Ingestion**: Load the dataset into PyArrow tables for efficient memory usage.  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, normalize numerical variables, and encode categorical features.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features such as average price per neighborhood and host experience length.  
- **Model Training**: Train regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) using processed data.  
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate performance with MAE and RMSE, comparing PyArrow pipelines vs standard Pandas workflows.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Benchmark runtime and memory usage between Arrow-based and Pandas-only pipelines.  
- Visualize price distributions across neighborhoods and property types.

### Project 2: Analyzing Global Weather Patterns  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  

**Project Objective**:  
Analyze historical weather data to identify temperature and precipitation trends across regions, and forecast future climate patterns using machine learning.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data  
- **Link**: [Climate Change Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Ingestion**: Use PyArrow to handle large climate datasets efficiently.  
- **Preprocessing**: Clean missing values, unify units, and aggregate data by region and time.  
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualize long-term temperature and precipitation trends.  
- **Forecasting Models**: Implement ARIMA, Prophet, or Random Forest regressors for time series forecasting.  
- **Evaluation**: Compare forecast accuracy with MAE and RMSE.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Add COâ‚‚ concentration datasets to analyze correlations with rising temperatures.  
- Visualize country-level climate anomalies over time with interactive dashboards.

### Project 3: Streaming News Article Classification  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  

**Project Objective**:  
Build a system that simulates real-time classification of news articles into categories such as politics, technology, sports, and business. The project focuses on using PyArrow for efficient text ingestion and batch-stream processing.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: News Category Dataset (200,000+ headlines from HuffPost)  
- **Link**: [News Category Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Ingestion**: Store and load the large dataset in Arrow format for optimized memory usage.  
- **Preprocessing**: Clean headlines (lowercasing, stopword removal, tokenization) and prepare text embeddings (TF-IDF or pretrained word embeddings).  
- **Model Training**: Train multiple classifiers:  
  - Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes (baseline).  
  - Random Forest or XGBoost for structured text features.  
  - Deep learning model (LSTM, Transformer-based) for richer representations.  
- **Streaming Simulation**: Feed batches of new headlines into the system to mimic real-time article classification.  
- **Evaluation**: Use accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices to measure classification performance.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Compare Arrow-based pipelines vs Pandas-only processing for large-scale text.  
- Build an interactive dashboard (Streamlit/Dash) to display real-time category distributions of incoming headlines.  
- Extend the project to sentiment analysis (positive/negative tone) in addition to category classification.
