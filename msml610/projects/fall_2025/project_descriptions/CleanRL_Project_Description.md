## Description  
CleanRL is a Python library designed for Reinforcement Learning (RL) that provides a clean and simple interface for implementing various RL algorithms. It focuses on ease of use and clarity, allowing users to quickly prototype and experiment with different RL methods. The library is built on top of PyTorch and is highly modular, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced users.  

**Features of CleanRL:**  
- Implements a variety of state-of-the-art RL algorithms with minimal boilerplate code.  
- Supports environments from OpenAI Gym, making it easy to test and evaluate RL agents.  
- Provides utilities for logging and visualizing training progress.

## Project 1: Basic Reinforcement Learning with CartPole  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  

**Project Objective**: Train a reinforcement learning agent to balance a pole on a moving cart in the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the total reward by keeping the pole upright as long as possible.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- No external dataset is required; the CartPole environment is built into OpenAI Gym.  

**Tasks**:  
- **Set Up Environment**: Install CleanRL and OpenAI Gym, and create the CartPole environment.  
- **Implement RL Algorithm**: Use PPO or DQN from CleanRL to train the agent.  
- **Train the Agent**: Run multiple episodes, allowing the agent to learn from its actions and improve over time.  
- **Evaluate Performance**: Track average rewards and visualize training progress using built-in logging utilities.  
- **Fine-Tune Hyperparameters**: Experiment with learning rates, discount factors, and exploration strategies to optimize results.  

**Bonus Idea (Optional)**: Try different classic Gym environments such as MountainCar or LunarLander to test the agent’s adaptability.

## Project 2: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in a Grid World  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  

**Project Objective**: Create a multi-agent reinforcement learning system where agents must collaborate to reach designated goals in a grid world. The objective is to optimize the agents’ policies for effective teamwork.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- No external dataset is required; the grid world can be simulated using a custom environment created with OpenAI Gym.  

**Tasks**:  
- **Design Grid World Environment**: Implement a custom grid world environment where multiple agents can move and interact.  
- **Implement RL Algorithm**: Extend PPO from CleanRL to support multiple agents.  
- **Agent Collaboration**: Design a reward system that encourages cooperation between agents.  
- **Evaluate and Visualize**: Track agent performance through episode rewards and visualize their movement paths.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with reward shaping and learning configurations to improve cooperation.  

**NOTE**: CleanRL is designed for single-agent RL. Implementing multi-agent training will require **extending the provided PPO/DQN templates**. Students may simplify the task by starting with 2 agents and a small grid to keep computation feasible.  

**Bonus Idea (Optional)**: Add obstacles or competing objectives in the grid world to increase task complexity.

## Project 3: Reinforcement Learning for Stock Trading  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  

**Project Objective**: Develop a reinforcement learning agent that learns to trade stocks based on historical price data, aiming to maximize cumulative returns.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: "S&P 500 Stock Data" dataset available on Kaggle  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Preparation**: Preprocess the stock data to compute indicators such as moving averages, volatility, and momentum.  
- **Design Trading Environment**: Create a custom Gym environment where the agent can buy, sell, or hold a stock.  
- **Implement Advanced RL Algorithm**: Use DQN or Actor-Critic methods from CleanRL to train the trading agent.  
- **Training and Evaluation**: Train across multiple episodes and evaluate performance using cumulative returns and risk-adjusted metrics (e.g., Sharpe ratio).  
- **Backtesting**: Simulate the agent’s performance on unseen historical data for validation.  

**NOTE**: Stock datasets are high-dimensional and can be computationally expensive. Students should **focus on one or two stocks (e.g., AAPL, MSFT)** and daily data to ensure feasibility on a laptop or Google Colab.  

**Bonus Idea (Optional)**: Incorporate sentiment scores from financial news (using a public dataset) as additional features in the trading environment.
