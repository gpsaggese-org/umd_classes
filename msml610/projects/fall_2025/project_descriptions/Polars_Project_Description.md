**Project 1: Movie Ratings Analysis (Difficulty: 1 - Easy)**

**Project Objective**  
Analyze movie ratings from the MovieLens dataset to understand trends in user preferences over time and identify factors that influence ratings.

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- MovieLens 100K dataset available on Kaggle: [MovieLens 100K](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/)

**Tasks**  
- Load and Explore Data:  
  Use Polars to load the MovieLens dataset and perform initial data exploration to understand its structure.

- Data Cleaning:  
  Handle missing values and ensure data types are appropriate for analysis.

- Trend Analysis:  
  Analyze rating trends over time, identifying which genres are becoming more popular.

- Feature Engineering:  
  Create new features such as average ratings per genre and the number of ratings per movie.

- Visualization:  
  Use Polars with Matplotlib or Seaborn to visualize trends and insights from the analysis.

**Project 2: E-commerce Customer Segmentation (Difficulty: 2 - Medium)**

**Project Objective**  
Segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using clustering techniques, aiming to optimize marketing strategies.

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- Online Retail dataset available on UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Online Retail](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)

**Tasks**  
- Data Ingestion:  
  Load the Online Retail dataset using Polars and perform exploratory data analysis to understand customer behavior.

- Data Preprocessing:  
  Clean the data by removing duplicates and handling missing values, particularly in customer IDs and purchase amounts.

- Feature Engineering:  
  Generate features such as total spending, frequency of purchases, and recency of last purchase.

- Clustering Analysis:  
  Implement K-means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior.

- Evaluate Clusters:  
  Analyze the characteristics of each cluster and visualize the results to identify patterns and insights.

**Project 3: COVID-19 Case Prediction (Difficulty: 3 - Hard)**

**Project Objective**  
Build a predictive model to forecast COVID-19 cases using time-series analysis, focusing on the impact of various factors like mobility and public health measures.

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- COVID-19 Open Data by Google Cloud: [COVID-19 Open Data](https://covid19data.com/)  
- Mobility data from Google: [Google Mobility Reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/)

**Tasks**  
- Data Collection:  
  Use Polars to load COVID-19 case data and mobility data from the respective sources.

- Data Merging:  
  Merge datasets based on date and geographical locations to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

- Feature Engineering:  
  Create features such as daily new cases, mobility changes, and public health measures implemented.

- Time-Series Forecasting:  
  Utilize ARIMA or Prophet models to predict future COVID-19 cases based on historical data and engineered features.

- Model Evaluation:  
  Assess model performance using metrics like RMSE and visualize predictions against actual case numbers to evaluate accuracy.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- For Project 1: Compare ratings trends between different demographic groups (e.g., age, gender) if demographic data is available.
- For Project 2: Experiment with different clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering) and compare results.
- For Project 3: Integrate additional datasets such as vaccination rates or hospital capacity and assess their impact on predictions.
