**Project Objective**: 
Create a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to generate text based on a given seed text, optimizing for coherence and relevance in the generated output.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Shakespeare's works dataset available on Hugging Face: [Shakespeare Text Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/shakespeare).

**Tasks**:
- Data Preparation:
    - Load the Shakespeare dataset, preprocess the text, and create sequences for training.
- Model Architecture:
    - Build an RNN using Flax, including embedding layers and LSTM cells for text generation.

### Project 3: Time Series Forecasting with Transformers (Difficulty: 3)

**Project Objective**: 
Develop a Transformer model to forecast stock prices using historical data, optimizing for prediction accuracy over multiple time horizons.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Yahoo Finance stock price dataset available via the yfinance library: [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/).

**Tasks**:
- Data Collection:
    - Use the yfinance library to collect historical stock price data for a chosen company (e.g., Apple Inc.).
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Preprocess the data by creating time series sequences and splitting into training and testing sets.
- Model Development:
    - Implement a Transformer architecture using Flax, focusing on self-attention layers for capturing temporal dependencies.
- Training:
    - Train the model on the historical data, tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the model's forecasting ability using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and visualize predictions against actual prices.
- Bonus Ideas:
    - Experiment with different Transformer configurations (e.g., varying the number of layers) and compare performance with traditional models like ARIMA.
