**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- CIFAR-10 dataset, available on Hugging Face: [CIFAR-10](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cifar10).  

**Tasks**:  
- Data Preprocessing:  
    - Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset, including normalization and augmentation.  
- Model Building:  
    - Construct a CNN using Flax, defining layers for convolution, pooling, and activation functions.  
- Training:  
    - Train the model on the training set and validate on the test set, using a suitable optimizer.

**Project Objective**:  
Create a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to generate text based on a given seed text, optimizing for coherence and relevance in the generated output.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Shakespeare's works dataset available on Hugging Face: [Shakespeare Text Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/shakespeare).  

**Tasks**:  
- Data Preparation:  
    - Load the Shakespeare dataset, preprocess the text, and create sequences for training.  
- Model Architecture:  
    - Build an RNN using Flax, including embedding layers and LSTM cells for text generation.  
- Training:  
    - Train the RNN on the prepared sequences, implementing teacher forcing for better learning.  
- Text Generation:  
    - Generate text by sampling from the trained model using a seed phrase, exploring different temperature settings.  
- Evaluation:  
    - Evaluate the generated text for coherence and creativity, possibly using BLEU scores or human evaluation.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Compare RNN performance with GRUs or a small Transformer built in Flax.  
- Try training on modern text datasets (e.g., news articles, song lyrics) to compare styles.  
- Implement beam search decoding for more coherent text generation.

### Project 3: Time Series Forecasting with Transformers (Difficulty: 3)

**Project Objective**:  
Develop a Transformer model to forecast stock prices using historical data, optimizing for prediction accuracy over multiple time horizons.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- NASDAQ Historical Data dataset on Kaggle: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/stock-market-data)  

**Tasks**:  
- Data Collection:  
    - Load historical stock price data from the NASDAQ Historical Data dataset on Kaggle, which contains daily price and volume information for multiple companies.  
- Data Preprocessing:  
    - Preprocess the data by creating time series sequences and splitting into training and testing sets.  
- Model Development:  
    - Implement a Transformer architecture using Flax, focusing on self-attention layers for capturing temporal dependencies.  
- Training:  
    - Train the model on the historical data, tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.  
- Evaluation:  
    - Evaluate the model's forecasting ability using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and visualize predictions against actual prices.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Compare Transformer forecasts with classical models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet).  
- Add exogenous variables like trading volume or economic indicators as features.  
- Extend to multi-step forecasting (predict weeks or months ahead).  
- Perform backtesting to evaluate robustness across different time periods.
