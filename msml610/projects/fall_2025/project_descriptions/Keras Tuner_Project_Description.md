**Description**

Keras Tuner is a powerful library for hyperparameter tuning of Keras models, enabling users to optimize model performance efficiently. It provides an intuitive interface for defining search spaces and automating the tuning process. Keras Tuner supports various search algorithms, such as Random Search, Hyperband, and Bayesian Optimization, making it versatile for different modeling scenarios.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional):**  
- For Project 1: Reframe as a classification task (pass/fail prediction) and compare results.  
- For Project 2: Use transfer learning with EfficientNet and fine-tune with Keras Tuner.  
- For Project 3: Extend to multi-step forecasting (predict multiple days ahead) and compare with Prophet or ARIMA baselines.
