**Description**

Keras Tuner is a powerful library for hyperparameter tuning of Keras models, enabling users to optimize model performance efficiently. It provides an intuitive interface for defining search spaces and automating the tuning process. Keras Tuner supports various search algorithms, such as Random Search, Hyperband, and Bayesian Optimization, making it versatile for different modeling scenarios.

**Project 1: Predicting House Prices (Difficulty: 1)**

**Project Objective**: The goal is to build a regression model that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities, while optimizing the model's hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the “House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques” dataset available on Kaggle.

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Load the dataset using Pandas and handle missing values appropriately.
    - Normalize numerical features and encode categorical features using one-hot encoding.
  
- Model Selection:
    - Define a simple feedforward neural network architecture using Keras.
  
- Hyperparameter Tuning:
    - Utilize Keras Tuner to optimize key hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, units per layer, and learning rate.

- Model Training and Evaluation:
    - Train the model with the best hyperparameters and evaluate performance using metrics like RMSE.

- Visualization:
    - Plot the predicted vs. actual house prices to visualize model performance.

**Project Objective**: The aim is to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into ten different categories, optimizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve high accuracy through hyperparameter tuning.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the CIFAR-10 dataset available directly through TensorFlow Datasets.

**Tasks**:
- Data Loading and Augmentation:

- CNN Architecture Design:
    - Create a convolutional neural network model with initial parameters.

- Hyperparameter Tuning:
    - Implement Keras Tuner to explore different architectures (e.g., number of convolutional layers, dropout rates, and activation functions).

- Model Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the tuned model on a validation set and report accuracy, precision, and recall.

- Visualization:
    - Use Matplotlib to visualize the training history (loss and accuracy) and display some misclassified images.

**Project 3: Time Series Forecasting with LSTMs (Difficulty: 3)**

**Project Objective**: The project focuses on predicting future values in a time series dataset (e.g., stock prices) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, optimizing the network's architecture and hyperparameters for improved forecasting accuracy.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the “S&P 500 Stock Prices” dataset available on Kaggle.

**Tasks**:
- Data Preparation:
    - Load the stock price data and preprocess it by normalizing and creating sequences for the LSTM model.

- LSTM Model Development:
    - Define an initial LSTM architecture with appropriate input shapes.

- Hyperparameter Tuning:
    - Use Keras Tuner to optimize hyperparameters such as the number of LSTM layers, units per layer, batch size, and dropout rates.

- Model Training and Evaluation:
    - Train the LSTM model with the best hyperparameters and evaluate using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

- Visualization:
    - Plot the predicted vs. actual stock prices over time to assess the model's forecasting capability.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- For Project 1: Experiment with ensemble methods by combining multiple models and comparing performance.
- For Project 2: Implement transfer learning by using a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG16) and fine-tuning it with Keras Tuner.
- For Project 3: Extend the project by incorporating additional features such as technical indicators and performing multi-step forecasting.
