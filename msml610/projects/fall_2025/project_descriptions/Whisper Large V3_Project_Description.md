**Project 1: Podcast Transcription and Analysis**  
**Difficulty:** 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective:** Create a system to transcribe a selected podcast episode and perform basic sentiment analysis on the transcribed text to identify positive, negative, and neutral sentiments throughout the episode.

**Dataset Suggestions:**  
- Podcast episodes available on platforms like Spotify or Apple Podcasts. Choose a specific episode and download the audio file.

**Tasks:**
- **Audio Ingestion:** Download the selected podcast episode in a supported audio format.
- **Transcription with Whisper:** Use Whisper Large V3 to transcribe the audio into text.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Clean the transcribed text for analysis (remove filler words, punctuation).
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilize a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (e.g., VADER) to classify segments of the transcript.
- **Visualization:** Create a sentiment trend graph to visualize the fluctuations in sentiment over the episode.

**Project 2: Multilingual Customer Support Chatbot**  
**Difficulty:** 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective:** Develop a multilingual customer support chatbot that can transcribe voice messages from customers, understand their intent, and respond in the same language.

**Dataset Suggestions:**  
- Use the Common Voice dataset from Hugging Face, which contains voice recordings in various languages.

**Tasks:**
- **Voice Message Ingestion:** Collect voice messages from users in different languages.
- **Transcription with Whisper:** Implement Whisper Large V3 to transcribe the voice messages into text.
- **Intent Recognition:** Use a language model (like BERT) to classify the intent of the transcribed text.
- **Response Generation:** Create a response generation mechanism using a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-3) that generates responses based on recognized intents.
- **Feedback Loop:** Implement a feedback mechanism to improve the chatbot's accuracy over time based on user interactions.

**Project 3: Speech-to-Text for Accessibility in Education**  
**Difficulty:** 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective:** Build a tool that transcribes and summarizes classroom lectures in real-time, making educational content more accessible to students with hearing impairments.

**Dataset Suggestions:**  
- Record live lectures or use publicly available lecture recordings from platforms like Coursera or edX. Ensure the audio files are accessible without authentication.

**Tasks:**
- **Real-time Audio Capture:** Set up a system to capture audio from live lectures using a microphone.
- **Transcription with Whisper:** Use Whisper Large V3 to transcribe the audio in real-time, ensuring low latency.
- **Summarization:** Implement a text summarization model (e.g., BART) to create concise summaries of the transcribed lectures.
- **Accessibility Features:** Develop a user interface that displays the transcriptions and summaries, allowing users to adjust font size and background color for better readability.
- **Evaluation:** Conduct usability testing with students who have hearing impairments to assess the effectiveness and user-friendliness of the tool.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional):**  
- For Project 1, analyze the most frequently discussed topics in the podcast using topic modeling.
- For Project 2, integrate sentiment analysis to gauge customer satisfaction based on voice tone.
- For Project 3, explore the integration of sign language avatars or visual aids alongside transcriptions for enhanced accessibility.
