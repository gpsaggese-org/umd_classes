**Project 1: Speech Emotion Recognition**
- **Difficulty**: 1
- **Project Objective**: Detect emotion in speech using an automated audio analysis pipeline with optimized inference.
- **Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "RAVDESS Emotional Speech Audio" dataset on Kaggle.
- **Tasks**:
  - Load and preprocess the RAVDESS dataset using Librosa for feature extraction.
  - Implement a basic Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model using PyTorch.
  - Convert the model to a format compatible with Apache TVM.
  - Use Apache TVM to optimize the model for CPU inference and benchmark performance. 
  - Compare results with an unoptimized baseline and analyze real-time response.

**Project 2: Urban Sound Classification**
- **Difficulty**: 2
- **Project Objective**: Classify urban sounds using a deep learning model, optimized for lower latency inference with TVM.
- **Dataset Suggestions**: Use "UrbanSound8K" from Kaggle, a collection of audio files for sound classification tasks.
- **Tasks**:
  - Load, preprocess, and augment audio data from the UrbanSound8K with Mel-spectrogram representations.
  - Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow or Keras to classify the sounds.
  - Use Apache TVM to optimize the CNN for deployment on a Raspberry Pi (simulated in Colab).
  - Evaluate model performance and inference time improvements on different hardware configurations.
  - Evaluate classification accuracy and compare inference time across hardware (CPU vs GPU, TVM vs non-TVM).  


**Project 3: Large-Scale Document Anomaly Detection**
- **Difficulty**: 3
- **Project Objective**: Detect anomalies in large-scale document metadata using optimized machine learning pipelines.
- **Dataset Suggestions**: Utilize the AG News Classification Dataset (Kaggle)

- **Tasks**:
  - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand document stats and metadata.
  - Use pre-trained BERT embeddings to represent documents.
  - Train an anomaly detection model like Isolation Forest on these embeddings.
