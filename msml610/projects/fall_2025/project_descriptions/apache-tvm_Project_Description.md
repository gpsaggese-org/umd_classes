**Description**

Apache TVM is an open-source machine learning compiler stack that enables efficient deployment of deep learning models across a variety of hardware platforms. It optimizes the performance of models through techniques such as tensor computation and automatic optimization, allowing developers to run machine learning models on a wide range of devices, including CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators.
