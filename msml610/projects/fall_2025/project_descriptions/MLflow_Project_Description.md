**Description**

MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment. It provides a set of tools to track experiments, package code into reproducible runs, and manage and deploy models. 

Technologies Used
MLflow

- Experiment Tracking: Log and query experiments, including parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
- Model Management: Package and deploy machine learning models in a variety of formats.
- Reproducibility: Easily reproduce runs with the same code and data.

### Project 1: Predicting House Prices
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: Build a regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. The goal is to optimize the model for accuracy and interpretability.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset available on Kaggle.

**Tasks**:
- Set Up MLflow Tracking:
  - Initialize MLflow and configure tracking URI to log experiments.
  
- Data Preprocessing:
  - Load the dataset and perform necessary cleaning (handle missing values, encode categorical variables).
  
- Model Training:
  - Train a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression) and log parameters and metrics (RMSE) using MLflow.
  
- Model Evaluation:
  - Evaluate the model performance on a validation set and log results.
  
- Visualization:
  - Visualize model performance and feature importance using Matplotlib or Seaborn.

### Project 2: Customer Segmentation Using Clustering
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)

**Project Objective**: Implement a clustering algorithm to segment customers based on purchasing behavior, optimizing for distinct and meaningful clusters.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Online Retail" dataset available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle.

**Tasks**:
- Set Up MLflow Environment:
  - Initialize MLflow and set up experiment tracking for clustering runs.
  
- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering:
  - Clean the dataset, perform feature engineering (e.g., total purchase amount, frequency), and log transformations.
  
- Clustering Model Development:
  - Apply K-Means clustering and log the model parameters and silhouette scores with MLflow.
  
- Cluster Analysis:
  - Analyze the characteristics of each cluster and log results, including visualizations of clusters.
  
- Deployment and Reporting:
  - Package the clustering model for deployment and generate a report summarizing findings.

### Project 3: Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: Develop a natural language processing (NLP) model to classify sentiment from product reviews, optimizing for precision and recall in predictions.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Amazon Product Reviews" dataset available on Kaggle.

**Tasks**:
- Initialize MLflow:
  - Set up MLflow to track experiments and log model parameters and metrics.

- Data Preprocessing:
  - Clean and preprocess text data (tokenization, stopword removal) using libraries like NLTK or SpaCy, and log preprocessing steps.

- Model Selection and Training:
  - Train multiple NLP models (e.g., Logistic Regression, BERT) for sentiment classification and log metrics (accuracy, F1 score) with MLflow.

- Hyperparameter Tuning:
  - Implement hyperparameter tuning using MLflowâ€™s built-in support for tracking different runs and selecting the best model.

- Model Evaluation and Comparison:
  - Evaluate and compare model performance using confusion matrix and ROC curves, logging visualizations in MLflow.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Experiment with advanced NLP techniques like transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., fine-tuning BERT).
- Implement a web app using Flask or Streamlit to showcase the sentiment analysis model in real-time.
- Compare model performance against a baseline model (e.g., a simple rule-based sentiment classifier).
