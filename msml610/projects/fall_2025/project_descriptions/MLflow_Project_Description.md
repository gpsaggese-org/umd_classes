**MLflow** is an open-source platform designed to manage the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It streamlines the process of tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models. Key features of MLflow include:

- **Tracking**: Log and query experiments, metrics, parameters, and artifacts.
- **Projects**: Package data science code in a reusable, reproducible format.
- **Models**: Manage and deploy models from various ML libraries.
- **Registry**: Central repository to manage the full lifecycle of MLflow Models.

**Project 1: Predicting Air Quality Index Using Time Series Data**

- **Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)
- **Project Objective**: Predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) in a given city using historical data.
- **Dataset Suggestions**: "Delhi Air Quality Data" available on Kaggle.
- **Tasks**:
  - Load and explore the dataset using Pandas and Matplotlib.
  - Use MLflow to track experiments with different time series forecasting models like ARIMA or Prophet.
  - Implement a simple baseline model and log its performance metrics.
  - Utilize MLflow to save and compare the models' performance. 
  - Also use MLflow to track hyperparameters like ARIMA order or Prophet seasonality modes.
- **Bonus Ideas**: Implement a dashboard using Flask that visualizes predictions vs. actual data over time.

**Project 2: Identifying Anomalies in Network Traffic**

- **Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)
- **Project Objective**: Detect anomalies in network traffic that could indicate potential security threats.
- **Dataset Suggestions**: "CICIDS2017" dataset from Kaggle.
- **Tasks**:
  - Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and normalize features.
  - Train an ensemble of anomaly detection models like Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM.
  - Use MLflow to log parameters and metrics, comparing model performances.
  - Implement a model registry with MLflow to manage different versions.
- **Bonus Ideas**: Test the model on streaming data using a simulated network traffic generator.

**Project 3: Forecasting Renewable Energy Production**

- **Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)
- **Project Objective**: Build a system to forecast the production of renewable energy sources like wind or solar.
- **Dataset Suggestions**: "Wind Power Forecasting" dataset from Kaggle.
- **Tasks**:
  - Conduct exploratory data analysis using Python libraries to understand patterns in energy production.
  - Engineer features such as weather data or time of day to enhance model accuracy.
  - Use MLflow to log experiments across various deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, GRU) for time series forecasting.
  - Evaluate and compare model performance; deploy the best model using MLflow's deployment capabilities.
- **Bonus Ideas**: Integrate an external API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to enhance forecasting with real-time weather data.
