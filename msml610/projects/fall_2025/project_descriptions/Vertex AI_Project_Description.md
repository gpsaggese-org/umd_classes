### Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction (Difficulty: 1 - Easy)

**Project Objective**  
Develop a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn (leave the service) based on historical data. The goal is to optimize retention strategies by targeting at-risk customers.

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- **Dataset**: Telco Customer Churn Dataset  
- **Source**: Available on Kaggle ([Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn))

**Tasks**  
- Data Ingestion: Load the dataset into Vertex AI and explore its structure.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical features.
- Model Training: Use Vertex AI’s AutoML capabilities to train a classification model.
- Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Deployment: Deploy the trained model as an endpoint for predictions.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Implement a feature importance analysis to understand key factors influencing churn.
- Explore different classification algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for comparison.

### Project 2: Real Estate Price Prediction (Difficulty: 2 - Medium)

**Project Objective**  
Create a regression model to predict real estate prices based on various features like location, size, and amenities. The aim is to provide accurate price estimates for potential buyers.

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- **Dataset**: Ames Housing Dataset  
- **Source**: Available on Kaggle ([Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prestonvong/ames-housing-data))

**Tasks**

### Project 3: Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Posts (Difficulty: 3 - Hard)

**Project Objective**  
Develop a natural language processing (NLP) model to analyze sentiments expressed in social media posts regarding a specific brand or product. The goal is to detect positive, negative, and neutral sentiments to inform marketing strategies.

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- **Dataset**: Twitter US Airline Sentiment  
- **Source**: Available on Kaggle ([Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment))

**Tasks**  
- Data Ingestion: Load the Twitter sentiment dataset into Vertex AI and explore the text data.
- Text Preprocessing: Clean the text data by removing stop words, special characters, and tokenizing.
- Model Training: Train a sentiment classification model using Vertex AI’s NLP capabilities or pre-trained models.
- Fine-tuning: Fine-tune the model for improved accuracy using Vertex AI’s hyperparameter tuning features.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using F1-score and confusion matrix to assess its performance.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Implement a dashboard to visualize sentiment trends over time using Google Data Studio.
- Explore transfer learning with pre-trained models like BERT to improve sentiment classification accuracy.
