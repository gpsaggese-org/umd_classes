## Description  
Caffe is a deep learning framework developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) that excels in image classification, segmentation, and other computer vision tasks. It is known for its speed and modularity, allowing users to define and train deep learning models efficiently.  

**Features:**  
- Provides a flexible architecture for defining deep learning models using simple configuration files (`.prototxt`).  
- Supports various layers and pre-trained models for transfer learning.  
- Optimized for performance on both CPU and GPU, enabling fast training and inference.

## Project 1: Image Classification of Natural Objects  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  

**Project Objective**:  
Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of natural objects (airplanes, cats, dogs, cars, etc.) into categories.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10 dataset (60,000 color images across 10 classes).  
- **Link**: [CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Set Up Caffe Environment**: Install and configure Caffe.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Load CIFAR-10, normalize pixel values, and split into train/test sets.  
- **Define CNN Architecture**: Use Caffeâ€™s `.prototxt` files to build a small CNN (e.g., 3 convolutional layers + fully connected).  
- **Train Model**: Train on CIFAR-10 and monitor training loss/accuracy.  
- **Evaluate Performance**: Test on validation set and calculate metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix).  
- **Visualization**: Plot training curves and visualize sample predictions.  

**Bonus Idea (Optional)**: Compare performance of a simple CNN with a deeper pre-trained model such as AlexNet.

## Project 2: Car Image Segmentation (Binary Masks)  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  

**Project Objective**:  
Develop a segmentation model in Caffe to separate cars from the background in images, using binary masks.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: Carvana Image Masking Dataset (20,000 car images with corresponding masks).  
- **Link**: [Carvana Image Masking Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Preparation**: Load car images and masks, resize to manageable resolution, and augment with flips/crops.  
- **Model Architecture**: Implement a simplified U-Net or Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) using `.prototxt` in Caffe.  
- **Training**: Train segmentation model on car images with binary masks. Use IoU/Dice coefficient for evaluation.  
- **Evaluation**: Compare predictions with ground truth masks, and visualize overlays on test images.  
- **Experimentation**: Tune hyperparameters (learning rate, optimizer) and test different data augmentations.  

**Bonus Idea (Optional)**: Extend to multi-class segmentation by labeling additional features (e.g., windows, wheels).

## Project 3: Object Detection with Faster R-CNN  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  

**Project Objective**:  
Build an object detection system using Faster R-CNN in Caffe to detect and classify objects in images.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: Pascal VOC 2007/2012 dataset (widely used for object detection, smaller than COCO).  
- **Link**: [Pascal VOC Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gopalbhattrai/pascal-voc-2012-dataset)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Set Up Faster R-CNN in Caffe**: Use the official Faster R-CNN implementation available in Caffe.  
- **Data Preparation**: Download Pascal VOC dataset, convert annotations to VOC format if needed.  
- **Model Configuration**: Define Faster R-CNN architecture (`.prototxt`) with pre-trained backbone (e.g., ResNet or VGG).  
- **Train / Fine-tune Model**: Fine-tune using Pascal VOC training set.  
- **Evaluation**: Compute mAP for object detection performance and visualize bounding boxes on sample images.  
- **Deployment**: Test object detection on new images or a short video clip.  

**Bonus Idea (Optional)**: Integrate an object tracking algorithm (e.g., SORT) to maintain object identity across frames.
