**Tool Description: PyTorch Geometric**  
PyTorch Geometric is a library built on top of PyTorch that facilitates deep learning on irregularly structured data, particularly graphs. It provides efficient implementations of various graph neural network (GNN) architectures, along with data loaders and utilities for handling graph-structured data. Key features include:
- Support for various graph neural network architectures (e.g., GCN, GAT).
- Efficient data handling for large graphs.
- Predefined datasets and utilities for graph processing.
- Built-in support for message passing and graph convolutions.

**Project 1: Social Network Analysis for Community Detection**

**Difficulty: 1 Easy**

**Project Objective**
The goal is to identify and visualize communities within a social network graph by learning node embeddings and clustering them into groups, optimizing for modularity as a measure of community structure.

**Dataset Suggestions**
Use the "Facebook Social Network" dataset available on Kaggle

**Tasks**

- Load and preprocess the social network graph using PyTorch Geometric utilities.
- Train a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to learn node embeddings.
- Apply a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means) to group nodes into communities.
- Evaluate clustering quality using modularity and visualize communities in the graph.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**
Experiment with different GNN architectures (e.g., GAT) for embeddings; try other clustering methods (spectral clustering, DBSCAN) and compare results.


### Project 2: Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions  
**Difficulty**: 2  
**Project Objective**: The aim is to detect fraudulent transactions in a financial network by classifying transaction nodes, optimizing for precision and recall metrics.  

**Dataset Suggestions**: Utilize the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dalpozz/creditcard-fraud).  

**Tasks**:
- Construct a transaction graph where nodes represent accounts and edges represent transactions.
- Use node embeddings from a GraphSAGE model to capture transaction patterns.
- Train a classifier (e.g., logistic regression) on the embeddings to identify fraudulent transactions.
- Evaluate the model using precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.

**Bonus Ideas**: Implement a semi-supervised learning approach to improve fraud detection; analyze the model's performance on different transaction types.

### Project 3: Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction  
**Difficulty**: 3  
**Project Objective**: The goal is to predict potential interactions between drugs based on their molecular structures represented as graphs, optimizing for the accuracy of predictions.  

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Drug-Drug Interaction" dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrews124/drug-drug-interaction).  

**Tasks**:
- Transform molecular structures into graph representations using atom and bond information.
- Implement a Graph Neural Network (GNN) like Graph Attention Network (GAT) to learn drug representations.
- Train the model to predict interactions between drug pairs and evaluate using ROC-AUC scores.
- Analyze feature importance to understand which molecular features contribute to interactions.

**Bonus Ideas**: Explore transfer learning with pre-trained GNN models on similar datasets; conduct a comparative analysis with traditional machine learning methods for interaction prediction.
