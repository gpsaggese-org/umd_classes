**Project 1: Image Classification on CIFAR-10**  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of ten categories (e.g., airplane, automobile, bird, etc.). The goal is to achieve a high accuracy rate on the test set.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- CIFAR-10 dataset, available on Kaggle: [CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10)

**Tasks**:  
- Data Loading and Preprocessing:
  - Load the CIFAR-10 dataset using `torchvision.datasets`.
  - Normalize and augment the images for better model generalization.
  
- Model Definition:
  - Define a CNN architecture using PyTorch.
  - Wrap the model using Skorch to integrate with scikit-learn.

- Training:
  - Train the model on the training set with appropriate hyperparameters.
  - Monitor training loss and accuracy using Skorch callbacks.

- Evaluation:
  - Evaluate the model on the test set and report accuracy.
  - Visualize some predictions with true labels.

**Bonus Ideas**:

**Project 2: Predicting House Prices with Neural Networks**  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: Develop a neural network model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. The goal is to minimize the mean absolute error (MAE) of the predictions.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Ames Housing dataset, available on Kaggle: [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prestonv77/ames-housing-data)

**Tasks**:

  - Split the data into training and testing sets.

- Feature Engineering:
  - Select relevant features and create new features based on existing ones.
  - Normalize the feature set for better model performance.

- Model Creation:
  - Build a feedforward neural network using PyTorch.
  - Use Skorch to facilitate model training and evaluation.

- Training and Evaluation:
  - Train the model and tune hyperparameters using cross-validation.
  - Evaluate the model using MAE and visualize the predicted vs. actual prices.

**Bonus Ideas**:  
- Compare the performance of the neural network with traditional regression models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees).
- Implement feature importance techniques to identify the most influential features.

**Project 3: Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews**  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: Create a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the IMDb dataset. The goal is to classify reviews as positive or negative with high accuracy.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- IMDb Movie Reviews dataset, available on Kaggle: [IMDb Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-movie-reviews)

**Tasks**:  
- Data Preparation:
  - Load the IMDb dataset and preprocess the text (tokenization, padding).
  - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

- Model Development:
  - Construct an RNN or LSTM model using PyTorch for text classification.
  - Integrate the model with Skorch for seamless training and evaluation.

- Training and Hyperparameter Tuning:
  - Train the model on the training set and use validation data for tuning hyperparameters.
  - Implement callbacks for early stopping based on validation loss.

- Evaluation:
  - Evaluate the model on the test set using accuracy and F1-score.
  - Visualize confusion matrices and classification reports.

**Bonus Ideas**:  
- Experiment with pre-trained embeddings (e.g., GloVe, Word2Vec) to enhance model performance.
- Implement a model explainability technique (e.g., LIME) to interpret the predictions made by the RNN.
