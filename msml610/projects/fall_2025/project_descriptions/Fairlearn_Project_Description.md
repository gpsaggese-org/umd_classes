**Description**

Fairlearn is a Python library designed to assist in assessing and mitigating bias in machine learning models. It provides various algorithms and metrics to ensure fairness across different demographic groups, allowing data scientists to build more equitable AI systems. 

Technologies Used
Fairlearn

- Implements fairness constraints and metrics to evaluate model performance across different groups.
- Provides tools for post-processing and pre-processing to mitigate bias in predictions.
- Supports integration with popular machine learning frameworks such as Scikit-learn.

**Project 1: Fair Classification in Loan Approval**  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: The goal is to develop a classification model that predicts loan approval while ensuring fairness across different demographic groups (e.g., gender, race). The project aims to optimize the accuracy of the model while minimizing bias in approvals.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Use the "Home Equity Line of Credit" dataset on Kaggle, which includes demographic information along with loan approval decisions.

**Tasks**:  
- Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset and handle missing values.
- Train a Baseline Model: Build a standard classification model (e.g., logistic regression) to predict loan approval.
- Evaluate Fairness: Use Fairlearn to assess fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity) and identify bias in the model.
- Mitigate Bias: Apply Fairlearn's post-processing techniques to adjust the model predictions for fairness.
- Final Evaluation: Compare the performance of the biased and debiased models using accuracy and fairness metrics.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Compare multiple classification algorithms (e.g., decision trees, SVM) for fairness.
- Explore different fairness constraints and their impact on model performance.

**Project 2: Fairness in Employee Performance Evaluation**  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: The project aims to analyze and mitigate bias in employee performance evaluations using historical performance data, ensuring fairness across various employee demographics.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Use the "Employee Performance Evaluation" dataset available on Kaggle, which includes performance scores and demographic information.

**Tasks**:  
- Data Exploration: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of performance scores across different demographic groups.
- Model Development: Build a regression model to predict employee performance scores based on various features.
- Fairness Assessment: Utilize Fairlearn to evaluate fairness metrics (e.g., equal opportunity) and identify potential biases in the model.
- Fairness Mitigation: Implement Fairlearn’s techniques to ensure equitable performance evaluations across demographic groups.
- Reporting Results: Generate a report summarizing the findings, including visualizations of performance distributions pre- and post-mitigation.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Explore the impact of various features on performance evaluations and fairness.
- Implement a comparative analysis of fairness metrics across different regression models.

**Project 3: Fairness in Predictive Policing**  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: Develop a predictive policing model to forecast crime hotspots while ensuring that the model does not disproportionately target specific demographic groups, thus promoting fairness in law enforcement practices.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Use the "Chicago Crime Data" dataset available on Kaggle, which includes crime incidents along with demographic information of the areas.

**Tasks**:  
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, including geospatial features and demographic attributes.
- Model Training: Train a Random Forest or Gradient Boosted Trees model to identify potential crime hotspots based on historical data.
- Fairness Evaluation: Use Fairlearn to assess the fairness of the model predictions across different demographic groups (e.g., race, income).
- Mitigation Strategy: Implement Fairlearn’s pre-processing or in-processing techniques to reduce bias in predictions.
- Impact Analysis: Analyze the effects of fairness mitigation on model performance and discuss implications for policing practices.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Investigate the trade-offs between model accuracy and fairness in predictive policing.
- Explore the use of different fairness metrics and their implications on model interpretation.
