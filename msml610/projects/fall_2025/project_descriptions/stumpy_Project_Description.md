**Description**

In this project, students will utilize Stumpy, a Python library designed for time series analysis, particularly focusing on matrix profile calculations. Stumpy simplifies the process of identifying patterns, anomalies, and motifs in time series data, making it ideal for various applications in fields like finance, healthcare, and IoT. 

Technologies Used
Stumpy

- Efficiently computes matrix profiles for time series data.
- Supports motif discovery, anomaly detection, and time series similarity analysis.
- Integrates easily with NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.

**Project 1: Anomaly Detection in Air Quality Data**  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: Detect anomalies in real-time air quality data to identify pollution spikes and their potential causes.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Use the "Air Quality Data Set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Air Quality Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality).  
- Data contains hourly averaged responses from an array of gas sensors.

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize the air quality dataset, focusing on relevant features such as CO, NOx, and O3 levels.  
- **Matrix Profile Calculation**: Use Stumpy to compute the matrix profile for the time series data to identify potential anomalies.  
- **Anomaly Visualization**: Visualize detected anomalies on time series plots to understand their context and impact.  
- **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the anomaly detection using precision and recall metrics.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Compare anomaly detection results with other methods such as seasonal decomposition or traditional statistical methods.  
- Implement a real-time data ingestion pipeline using open APIs for live air quality data.

**Project 2: Motif Discovery in Financial Time Series**  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: Discover recurring patterns (motifs) in stock price movements to inform trading strategies.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Use the "S&P 500 Historical Data" dataset available on Kaggle: [S&P 500 Stock Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cnic92/stock-price-data).  
- The dataset includes daily closing prices for S&P 500 companies.

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Preparation**: Extract and preprocess closing price data for selected stocks, focusing on time series formatting.  
- **Matrix Profile Analysis**: Utilize Stumpy to compute the matrix profile and identify motifs in the stock price data.  
- **Pattern Analysis**: Analyze the identified motifs to understand their characteristics and potential implications for trading.  
- **Backtesting Strategy**: Develop a simple trading strategy based on identified motifs and backtest it against historical data.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Explore different window sizes for motif discovery and analyze the impact on results.  
- Implement a visualization tool to display identified motifs and their occurrences over time.

**Project 3: Seasonal Pattern Analysis in Energy Consumption Data**  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: Analyze seasonal patterns in electricity consumption data to optimize energy distribution and demand forecasting.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Use the "Household Electric Power Consumption" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Electric Power Consumption](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption).  
- This dataset contains measurements of electric power consumption in one household over a period of time.

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Clean the dataset and transform it into a suitable format for time series analysis, focusing on daily consumption values.  
- **Matrix Profile Computation**: Apply Stumpy to compute the matrix profile and identify seasonal patterns in energy consumption.  
- **Pattern Interpretation**: Analyze the seasonal patterns and their implications for energy distribution and forecasting.  
- **Forecasting Model Development**: Build and evaluate a forecasting model using identified seasonal patterns to predict future energy consumption.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Integrate weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity) to enhance the forecasting model.  
- Explore the impact of special events (holidays, weekends) on energy consumption patterns and their representation in the matrix profile.
