**Description**

mpi4py is a Python package that provides bindings of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard for the Python programming language, enabling parallel processing and distributed computing. It allows developers to easily write parallel applications that can run on multiple processors, making it ideal for high-performance computing tasks.

Technologies Used
mpi4py

- Facilitates communication between processes in a distributed computing environment.
- Supports point-to-point and collective communication operations.
- Allows for easy integration with NumPy for efficient array manipulation in parallel.

**Tasks**  
- Set Up mpi4py and Data Processing Libraries:
  - Install libraries such as pandas, numpy, and mpi4py in your environment.

- Data Preparation:
  - Load the MovieLens dataset and preprocess it to create user-item interaction matrices.

- Implement Collaborative Filtering:
  - Use matrix factorization techniques (e.g., SVD) to generate latent features for users and items.

- Parallel Computation:
  - Distribute the computation of user-item interactions and model training using mpi4py to handle large datasets efficiently.

- Model Evaluation:
  - Evaluate the recommendation system using metrics like RMSE or precision/recall on a test dataset.

- Scalability Discussion:
  - Analyze how the parallelization affects the performance and scalability of the recommendation system.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- For Project 1, consider adding a machine learning model to predict future temperatures based on historical data.
- For Project 2, try implementing transfer learning with pre-trained models and compare performance.
- For Project 3, explore hybrid recommendation systems by combining collaborative filtering with content-based methods.
