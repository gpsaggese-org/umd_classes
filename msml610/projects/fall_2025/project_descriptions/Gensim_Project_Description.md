**Description**

Gensim is a robust Python library designed for topic modeling and document similarity analysis using unsupervised learning. It excels in handling large text corpora and provides efficient algorithms for word embeddings, such as Word2Vec and FastText. Gensim allows for easy implementation of various NLP tasks, including document similarity, topic extraction, and text classification.

**Project 1: Text Classification of Movie Reviews**  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: The goal is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using a dataset of labeled reviews, optimizing for accuracy in classification.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset: Available on Kaggle ([IMDB Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)).

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Clean and tokenize the text data, removing stop words and punctuation.
- Word Embedding using Gensim:
    - Train a Word2Vec model on the preprocessed reviews to create word embeddings.
- Feature Extraction:
    - Convert the movie reviews into vectors using the trained Word2Vec model.
- Model Training:
    - Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression) using the extracted features.
- Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the model performances using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Experiment with different classification algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest).
- Implement a confusion matrix to visualize classification results.

### Project 2: Topic Modeling and Classification on News Articles
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  

**Project Objective**: The aim is to identify and visualize the main topics discussed in a collection of BBC news articles, and also build a text classifier to predict article categories (business, politics, sport, tech, entertainment). The project combines unsupervised and supervised NLP tasks for a deeper understanding of news data.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- [BBC News Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yufengdev/bbc-fulltext-and-category) (includes ~2,200 articles across 5 categories: business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech).  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Clean the dataset (lowercasing, stopword removal, tokenization).  
- **Topic Modeling with Gensim**:  
  - Use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract latent topics.  
  - Calculate coherence scores to determine the optimal number of topics.  
- **Visualization**:  
  - Use pyLDAvis to visualize the topic distribution and relationships.  
- **Text Classification**:  
  - Train word embeddings using Gensim’s Word2Vec or FastText.  
  - Build a supervised classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM) to predict the BBC category of each article.  
  - Evaluate classification performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- **Interpretation**:  
  - Compare the discovered topics with the labeled categories to see how well unsupervised modeling aligns with supervised classification.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Compare LDA with Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for topic extraction.  
- Perform cross-category analysis: see which categories share overlapping topics.  
- Use a neural classifier (e.g., simple feed-forward network with FastText embeddings) to compare performance with traditional ML models.

### Project 3: Document Similarity and Clustering in Research Papers
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  

**Project Objective**: The project aims to build a system that identifies similar research papers based on their abstracts and also groups papers into clusters of related research areas. This combines similarity ranking with unsupervised ML, optimizing for both precision in retrieval and quality of clusters.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Use a static arXiv dataset such as the [arXiv Dataset of 1.7M Papers](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv) on Kaggle, which contains abstracts and metadata across multiple domains.  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Clean and tokenize abstracts (remove special characters, stopwords, apply lowercasing).  
- **Word Embedding with Gensim**:  
  - Train a FastText model on the abstracts to generate embeddings.  
- **Document Vector Creation**:  
  - Represent each abstract as a dense vector (e.g., averaging word embeddings).  
- **Similarity Ranking**:  
  - Use cosine similarity to retrieve the most similar papers for a given abstract.  
- **Clustering with ML**:  
  - Apply unsupervised ML algorithms (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering) on document vectors to group papers by research themes.  
  - Evaluate clustering quality using metrics like Silhouette Score or Davies-Bouldin Index.  
- **Evaluation**:  
  - For similarity: validate top-ranked results for topical relevance.  
  - For clustering: analyze whether discovered clusters align with arXiv’s subject categories (e.g., cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.ML).  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Extend clustering to **topic labeling** by extracting keywords for each cluster.  
- Build a **hybrid recommendation system** that combines similarity search with cluster-based filtering.  
- Compare clustering performance when using Word2Vec vs. FastText embeddings.
