**Description**

Statsmodels is a powerful Python library for statistical modeling and hypothesis testing. It provides classes and functions for estimating various statistical models, performing statistical tests, and conducting data exploration. Key features include:

- Comprehensive support for linear regression, generalized linear models, time series analysis, and more.
- Built-in statistical tests for hypothesis testing.
- Integration with Pandas for easy data manipulation and analysis.

### Project 1: Time Series Analysis of Air Quality Data (Difficulty: 1 - Easy)

**Project Objective**: The goal of this project is to analyze air quality data over time to identify trends and seasonal patterns, as well as to predict future air quality indices.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Air Quality Data Set" available on Kaggle: [Air Quality Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/air-quality-data-set).

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Load the dataset and handle missing values.
    - Convert date columns to datetime format.
- Exploratory Data Analysis:
    - Visualize air quality trends over time using line plots.
    - Identify seasonal patterns using decomposition techniques.
- Time Series Modeling:
    - Fit an ARIMA model to the air quality index data.
    - Evaluate model performance using AIC and BIC criteria.
- Forecasting:
    - Generate forecasts for the next six months and visualize the predictions.

### Project 2: Customer Churn Prediction using Logistic Regression (Difficulty: 2 - Medium)

**Project Objective**: The objective is to predict customer churn in a telecom company using logistic regression, optimizing the model to accurately classify customers who are likely to leave.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset available on Kaggle: [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

**Tasks**:
- Data Cleaning:
    - Load the dataset and preprocess categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
    - Handle missing values appropriately.
- Feature Engineering:
    - Create new features based on existing data (e.g., tenure groups).
    - Normalize numerical features for better model performance.
- Model Training:
    - Split the data into training and testing sets.
    - Train a logistic regression model using Statsmodels.
- Model Evaluation:
    - Assess model accuracy and interpret coefficients to understand feature importance.
    - Generate ROC curves and calculate AUC for model evaluation.

### Project 3: Anomaly Detection in Financial Transactions (Difficulty: 3 - Hard)

**Project Objective**: The goal is to detect fraudulent transactions in a financial dataset using advanced statistical methods and anomaly detection techniques.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset available on Kaggle: [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dalpozz/creditcard-fraud).

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis to understand class distribution.
    - Handle class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE.
- Statistical Modeling:
    - Fit a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to predict the likelihood of fraud.
    - Use residual analysis to identify outliers and anomalies in the transaction data.
- Anomaly Detection:
    - Implement statistical tests to detect significant deviations from expected transaction patterns.
    - Validate the detection results against known fraudulent transactions.
- Model Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the effectiveness of the anomaly detection model using precision, recall, and F1-score.
    - Visualize the results with confusion matrices and ROC curves.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: 
- For Project 1, explore additional time series forecasting methods like SARIMA or Prophet.
- For Project 2, compare logistic regression results with other classifiers like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
- For Project 3, extend the project to include unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, such as Isolation Forest or DBSCAN.
