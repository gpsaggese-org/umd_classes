**Description of Snorkel**:  
Snorkel is a framework for programmatically generating training data using weak supervision, allowing data scientists to create labeled datasets efficiently without extensive manual labeling. It features:

- Ability to create labeling functions to generate noisy labels.
- Integration with various machine learning models for training and evaluation.
- Support for combining multiple sources of weak supervision.
- Tools for evaluating and selecting labeling functions based on their performance.

### Project 1: Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: Build a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, optimizing the accuracy of predictions.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Use the "IMDb Movie Reviews" dataset available on Kaggle: [IMDb Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of sentiments.
- **Labeling Function Creation**: Implement simple labeling functions to classify sentiments based on keywords.
- **Model Training**: Use a pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face Transformers for fine-tuning.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy and F1 score metrics.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Experiment with advanced labeling functions using regex patterns.
- Compare results with a baseline model trained on manually labeled data.

### Project 2: News Article Classification
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: Develop a multi-class classification model to categorize news articles into different topics, optimizing for precision and recall.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Use the "20 Newsgroups" dataset available on scikit-learn or the "News Category Dataset" from Kaggle: [News Category Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset).

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text data, including tokenization and removing stop words.
- **Weak Supervision Setup**: Create labeling functions based on article keywords and categories.
- **Model Training**: Train a text classification model using a pre-trained DistilBERT model from Hugging Face.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate using confusion matrix and classification report.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Implement a cross-validation strategy to assess the robustness of the labeling functions.
- Investigate the impact of different pre-trained models on classification performance.

### Project 3: Product Review Quality Assessment
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: Create a model to assess the quality of product reviews, detecting anomalies and classifying reviews as helpful or unhelpful, optimizing for anomaly detection.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Use the "Amazon Product Reviews" dataset available on Kaggle: [Amazon Product Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews).

**Tasks**:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conduct EDA to identify patterns and anomalies in review ratings.
- **Labeling Function Development**: Design complex labeling functions that combine multiple heuristics for identifying helpful reviews.
- **Anomaly Detection Model**: Use a pre-trained model such as BERT for feature extraction and implement an anomaly detection algorithm (e.g., Isolation Forest).
- **Final Evaluation**: Validate the model using precision-recall curves and ROC-AUC scores.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Explore the integration of additional data sources (e.g., product specifications) to improve labeling functions.
- Compare the performance of different anomaly detection techniques on the same dataset.
