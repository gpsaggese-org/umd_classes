## Description  
DGL (Deep Graph Library) is a Python library designed for deep learning on graphs. It provides a flexible framework that allows users to build and train graph neural networks (GNNs) efficiently. DGL supports various graph structures and enables seamless integration with popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.  

**Features of DGL:**  
- Supports various graph types including undirected, directed, and heterogeneous graphs.  
- Facilitates the implementation of state-of-the-art GNN architectures.  
- Provides efficient data handling and batching for large-scale graphs.

## Project 1: Social Network Analysis for Community Detection  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  

**Project Objective**: Identify and visualize communities within a social network by learning node embeddings and clustering them, optimizing for modularity.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: "Facebook Social Network" dataset on Kaggle  
- **Link**: [Facebook Social Network](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhendra/facebook-social-network)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Load the dataset and construct a graph where nodes represent users and edges represent friendships.  
- **Graph Representation**: Use DGL to represent the social network as a graph.  
- **Node Embeddings**: Train a GNN (e.g., GraphSAGE) to generate embeddings for users.  
- **Clustering**: Apply clustering (e.g., KMeans) on learned embeddings to detect communities.  
- **Evaluation**: Assess community quality using modularity and silhouette score.  
- **Visualization**: Plot detected communities using NetworkX or Matplotlib.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: Compare embeddings from different GNN architectures (e.g., GCN vs. GraphSAGE) for community detection.

## Project 2: Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  

**Project Objective**: Build a GNN-based classifier to detect fraudulent transactions by modeling relationships between users and their transaction patterns, optimizing for fraud detection accuracy.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset on Kaggle  
- **Link**: [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dalpozz/creditcard-fraud)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Graph Construction**: Represent the dataset as a bipartite graph (users ↔ transactions), where nodes are users and transactions, and edges indicate ownership.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract transaction-level features (amount, time) and user-level aggregated features.  
- **Model Development**: Implement a GNN model (e.g., Graph Attention Network, GAT) to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.  
- **Training and Evaluation**: Train the GNN and evaluate with precision, recall, and F1-score, handling class imbalance carefully.  
- **Anomaly Analysis**: Inspect misclassified cases to identify fraud patterns.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: Compare GNN performance with traditional models (Random Forest, SVM) or apply edge classification for fraud detection.

## Project 3: Movie Recommendation System  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  

**Project Objective**: Develop a GNN-based recommendation system that predicts user–movie preferences by treating it as a link prediction task, optimizing for top-N recommendation accuracy.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: "MovieLens 20M" dataset on Kaggle  
- **Link**: [MovieLens 20M](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Graph Construction**: Build a bipartite graph with users and movies as nodes, and edges representing user ratings.  
- **Graph Representation**: Incorporate edge weights (ratings) and node features (genres, metadata) into the graph.  
- **Model Training**: Implement a GNN (e.g., Graph Convolutional Network or GraphSAGE) for link prediction to estimate missing user–movie interactions.  
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the recommendation model using RMSE for rating prediction and precision@k/recall@k for top-N recommendations.  
- **Recommendation Generation**: Generate personalized recommendations for each user based on predicted interactions.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Incorporate side information (director, actors, tags) into the graph as heterogeneous node types.  
- Explore hybrid methods combining collaborative filtering with GNN-based embeddings.  
- Implement temporal GNNs to account for the evolution of user preferences over time.
