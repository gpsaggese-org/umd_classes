**Description**

TFLearn is a high-level library built on top of TensorFlow that simplifies the process of building deep learning models. It provides a user-friendly interface for defining and training neural networks, making it accessible for both beginners and advanced users. Key features include:

- **Modular architecture**: Allows for easy stacking of layers and creating complex models.
- **Pre-built layers and optimizers**: Offers a wide range of layers (e.g., convolutional, recurrent) and optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam, SGD).
- **Support for TensorBoard**: Facilitates visualization of training processes and model performance.
- **Integration with TensorFlow**: Leverages TensorFlow’s powerful capabilities while maintaining simplicity.

### Project 3: Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews (Difficulty: 3)

**Project Objective**: 
Implement a recurrent neural network (RNN) to classify movie reviews from the IMDb dataset as positive or negative based on the text content.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- IMDb Movie Reviews: Available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Load the dataset and preprocess text (tokenization, padding sequences).
- **Word Embeddings**: Use pre-trained embeddings (e.g., GloVe) to represent words in a dense vector space.
- **RNN Model Design**: Construct an RNN using LSTM layers in TFLearn for sequential data processing.
- **Training**: Train the model on the training set while using dropout for regularization to prevent overfitting.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on a test set using accuracy and F1-score metrics.
- **Error Analysis**: Analyze misclassified reviews to understand model limitations and potential improvements.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- For Project 1, experiment with data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
- For Project 2, compare the performance of the deep learning model with traditional regression models (e.g., linear regression).
- For Project 3, extend the model to multi-class sentiment classification (e.g., positive, neutral, negative) and explore transfer learning with pre-trained models.
