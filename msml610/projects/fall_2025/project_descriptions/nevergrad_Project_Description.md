**Description**

Nevergrad is an optimization library developed by Facebook Research, designed to help users optimize complex functions without requiring gradients. It provides a wide range of optimization algorithms suitable for various applications, including evolutionary algorithms, Bayesian optimization, and more.

Technologies Used
Nevergrad

- Offers a collection of optimization algorithms for black-box optimization problems.
- Supports both single-objective and multi-objective optimization.
- Provides easy integration with Python, allowing for seamless use in machine learning workflows.

**Project 1: Hyperparameter Tuning for Machine Learning Models**  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: Optimize the hyperparameters of a machine learning model to improve classification accuracy on the popular MNIST handwritten digits dataset.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset available on Kaggle: [MNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data).

**Tasks**:
- Load the Dataset: Import the MNIST dataset and preprocess the images for training.
- Define the Model: Choose a classification model (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) to work with.
- Implement Nevergrad for Hyperparameter Optimization: Use Nevergrad to define a search space for hyperparameters and optimize model performance.
- Train and Evaluate: Train the model with optimized hyperparameters and evaluate its accuracy on a validation set.
- Visualize Results: Plot the accuracy improvements and hyperparameter configurations using Matplotlib.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Compare the performance of different models after hyperparameter tuning.
- Implement cross-validation to ensure robustness in the evaluation process.

**Project 2: Feature Selection for Regression Models**  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: Identify the most important features influencing house prices using a regression model, optimizing the feature selection process with Nevergrad.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Ames Housing Dataset available on Kaggle: [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset and handle missing values, categorical features, and scaling.
- Define the Regression Model: Choose a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting).
- Use Nevergrad for Feature Selection: Implement Nevergrad to optimize the selection of features based on model performance metrics.
- Train the Model: Train the regression model using the selected features and evaluate its performance using metrics like RMSE.
- Analyze Feature Importance: Visualize the importance of the selected features and their impact on predictions.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Experiment with different regression models and compare their performance with the optimized features.
- Implement a recursive feature elimination approach alongside Nevergrad for comparison.

**Project 3: Multi-Objective Optimization for Portfolio Management**  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: Optimize a stock portfolio by balancing risk and return using multi-objective optimization techniques provided by Nevergrad.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Yahoo Finance API for historical stock prices (free and active) for selected companies (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Amazon).

**Tasks**:
- Data Acquisition: Use the Yahoo Finance API to fetch historical stock price data for selected companies.
- Define the Optimization Problem: Formulate the objectives for maximizing returns while minimizing risk (e.g., variance of returns).
- Implement Nevergrad for Multi-Objective Optimization: Use Nevergrad to optimize the weights of each stock in the portfolio based on the defined objectives.
- Evaluate Portfolio Performance: Calculate the expected return and risk of the optimized portfolio and visualize the efficient frontier.
- Sensitivity Analysis: Analyze how changes in stock weights affect the overall portfolio performance and risk.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Compare the optimized portfolio against a benchmark (e.g., S&P 500) to evaluate performance.
- Implement additional constraints (e.g., maximum investment per stock) and observe the impact on optimization results.
