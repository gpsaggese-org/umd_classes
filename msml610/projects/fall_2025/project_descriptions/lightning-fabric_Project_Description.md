**Description**

Lightning Fabric is a high-level framework built on PyTorch designed to simplify the process of building and training deep learning models. It provides a streamlined interface for managing model training, evaluation, and deployment, enabling users to focus on model architecture and performance rather than boilerplate code. 

Features:
- Simplifies multi-GPU training and distributed computing.
- Provides built-in support for logging and monitoring metrics.
- Facilitates easy integration with various data loaders and optimizers.
- Offers a flexible way to organize code for complex training loops and callbacks.

### Project 1: Predicting Housing Prices with Neural Networks
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: Build a regression model to predict housing prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. The goal is to optimize the model to achieve the lowest possible mean squared error (MSE).

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prestonvong/austin-housing-data) on Kaggle.

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preparation**: Load the dataset and perform basic preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).
- **Model Definition**: Use Lightning Fabric to define a simple feedforward neural network architecture for regression.
- **Training**: Implement the training loop using Lightning Fabric, optimizing the model with an appropriate loss function.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like MSE and RÂ² score.
- **Visualization**: Visualize predictions against actual prices using Matplotlib.

### Project 3: Time Series Forecasting with LSTM Networks
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: Develop an LSTM-based model to forecast future values in a time series dataset. The goal is to minimize forecasting error while handling complex, noisy data.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- [Air Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/air-quality-uci) on Kaggle.

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Load the dataset and perform time series specific preprocessing, including normalization and windowing for LSTM input.
- **Model Construction**: Use Lightning Fabric to construct an LSTM model tailored for time series forecasting.
- **Training with Checkpoints**: Implement a training loop with model checkpoints to save the best-performing model based on validation loss.
- **Forecasting**: Generate predictions for future time steps and evaluate the model using metrics like MAE and RMSE.
- **Visualization**: Plot the actual vs. predicted values to visualize forecasting performance.

**Bonus Ideas**: Experiment with different LSTM architectures or compare LSTM performance with traditional time series models like ARIMA.
