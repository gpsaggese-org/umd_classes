**Description**

Numpyro is a probabilistic programming library built on NumPy and JAX, designed for flexible and efficient Bayesian inference. It allows users to construct probabilistic models using a simple syntax and provides tools for posterior sampling using advanced techniques like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Numpyro is particularly useful for Bayesian data analysis, enabling users to perform tasks such as model fitting, uncertainty estimation, and hypothesis testing.

Technologies Used
Numpyro

- Enables probabilistic modeling with a user-friendly syntax.
- Supports advanced sampling techniques like NUTS (No-U-Turn Sampler) for efficient inference.
- Integrates seamlessly with JAX for automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration.

### Project 1: Bayesian Linear Regression with Numpyro
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: Build a Bayesian linear regression model to predict housing prices based on various features (e.g., size, number of bedrooms, location) and quantify uncertainty in the predictions.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "California Housing Prices" dataset available on Kaggle: [California Housing Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/california-housing-prices).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and normalizing features.
- **Model Specification**: Define a Bayesian linear regression model using Numpyro, specifying priors for the coefficients.
- **Sampling**: Utilize Numpyro's NUTS sampler to draw samples from the posterior distribution of the model parameters.
- **Posterior Analysis**: Analyze the posterior distributions to interpret the coefficients and their uncertainties.
- **Prediction**: Make predictions on a test set and visualize the predictions along with credible intervals.

### Project 2: Bayesian A/B Testing for Marketing Campaigns
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)

**Project Objective**: Evaluate the effectiveness of two marketing strategies by modeling conversion rates as a Bayesian inference problem, comparing the two strategies' performance.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Marketing Campaigns" dataset available on Kaggle: [Marketing Campaigns Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodsaldanha/marketing-campaigns).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preparation**: Clean the dataset and create binary conversion labels for the two marketing strategies.
- **Modeling**: Set up a Bayesian model to estimate the conversion rates for both strategies using Numpyro.
- **Incorporate Priors**: Define informative priors based on historical data or expert knowledge regarding conversion rates.
- **Inference**: Use Numpyro to sample from the posterior distributions of the conversion rates and compute credible intervals.
- **Decision Making**: Analyze the results to determine which marketing strategy is more effective based on posterior probabilities.

### Project 3: Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling for Sports Performance
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: Construct a hierarchical Bayesian model to analyze player performance in basketball, accounting for both individual player characteristics and team effects.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "NBA Player Stats" dataset available on Kaggle: [NBA Player Stats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-stats).

**Tasks**:
- **Data Wrangling**: Clean and preprocess the dataset, creating relevant features such as player efficiency ratings and team statistics.
- **Hierarchical Model Construction**: Define a hierarchical Bayesian model in Numpyro that captures both player-level and team-level effects on performance metrics.
- **Sampling and Inference**: Implement MCMC sampling using Numpyro to estimate the posterior distributions of player and team parameters.
- **Model Checking**: Perform posterior predictive checks to validate the model fit and assess the model's predictive performance.
- **Insights Extraction**: Analyze the results to extract insights about the impact of specific player characteristics on performance, accounting for team dynamics.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- For Project 1, explore the effect of including interaction terms in the regression model.
- For Project 2, implement a Bayesian model comparison to assess the relative effectiveness of more than two marketing strategies.
- For Project 3, extend the model to include temporal effects, analyzing how player performance evolves over seasons.
