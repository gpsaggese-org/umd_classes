NumPyro is a probabilistic programming library built on top of NumPy and JAX, designed for scalable and flexible Bayesian inference. It leverages JAX's automatic differentiation and GPU/TPU acceleration capabilities. NumPyro is particularly suitable for:

- **Scalable Inference**: Fast and efficient inference using JAX's XLA compilation.
- **Flexible Modeling**: Supports a wide range of probabilistic models with an intuitive syntax.
- **Automatic Differentiation**: Utilizes JAX's autodiff for gradient-based inference methods.
- **Compatibility**: Easily integrates with NumPy and other JAX-based libraries.

**Project 1: Bayesian Weather Forecasting**

- **Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)
- **Project Objective**: Develop a Bayesian model to predict future temperature trends using historical weather data.
- **Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Weather Dataset" from Kaggle, which contains historical weather data from various global locations.
- **Tasks**:
  - Preprocess the dataset to extract relevant features such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
  - Implement a Bayesian linear regression model using NumPyro to forecast temperature.
  - Evaluate the model's predictive performance and uncertainty quantification.
  - Visualize the results with credible intervals to assess forecast variability.
- **Bonus Ideas**: Explore the impact of additional features like geographical location or seasonal variations on model predictions.

**Project 2: Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling of Global CO2 Emissions**

- **Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)
- **Project Objective**: Use hierarchical Bayesian models to analyze and predict CO2 emissions across countries with shared and unique factors.
- **Dataset Suggestions**: The "Global CO2 Emissions" dataset available on Kaggle, containing country-level emissions data over several decades.
- **Tasks**:
  - Preprocess data to handle missing values and create country-specific datasets.
  - Construct a hierarchical Bayesian model with NumPyro to capture both global trends and country-specific deviations in CO2 emissions.
  - Perform posterior predictive checks and evaluate model fit.
  - Analyze the results to identify countries with significant deviations from global trends.
- **Bonus Ideas**: Investigate the effect of economic indicators or policy changes as covariates in the model.

**Project 3: Bayesian Topic Modeling on Scientific Papers**

- **Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)
- **Project Objective**: Implement a Bayesian topic model to discover latent topics in a collection of scientific papers.
- **Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "arXiv Dataset" from Kaggle, which includes metadata and abstracts of scientific papers from arXiv.org.
- **Tasks**:
  - Clean and preprocess text data, including tokenization and stopword removal.
  - Build a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model using NumPyro to identify topics.
  - Optimize the model using variational inference and evaluate topic coherence.
  - Visualize the discovered topics and their distribution across documents.
- **Bonus Ideas**: Explore dynamic topic modeling to track how topics evolve over time or compare with traditional LDA implementations for performance benchmarks.
