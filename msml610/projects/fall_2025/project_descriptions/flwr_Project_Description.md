**Description**

Flwr is a framework for federated learning in Python that enables the development of machine learning models while preserving data privacy. It allows for collaborative model training across multiple devices or servers without the need to centralize sensitive data. Key features include:

- **Federated Learning Support**: Facilitates the training of models across distributed data sources.
- **Privacy Preservation**: Ensures that raw data remains on the local devices, enhancing privacy and security.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- **Easy Integration**: Provides a simple API for integrating federated learning into existing projects.
