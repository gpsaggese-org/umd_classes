**Description**

In this series of projects, students will leverage SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a powerful tool for interpreting machine learning models. SHAP provides consistent and interpretable feature importance scores based on game theory, allowing users to understand the contribution of each feature to a model's predictions. This tool is particularly useful for explaining complex models such as ensemble methods and deep learning.

Technologies Used
SHAP

- Provides feature importance scores that explain the output of any machine learning model.
- Utilizes Shapley values from cooperative game theory to fairly distribute the prediction among features.
- Supports various model types, including tree-based models and neural networks.

### Project 1: Predicting House Prices with SHAP Explanations
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: Create a predictive model for house prices using the Ames Housing dataset and utilize SHAP to explain the feature contributions to the predicted prices.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Ames Housing dataset, available on Kaggle: [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prestonjason/ames-housing-data)

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Load and clean the dataset, handling missing values and categorical variables.
- Model Building:
    - Train a Random Forest Regressor on the dataset to predict house prices.
- SHAP Integration:
    - Use SHAP to compute feature importance scores and visualize them.
- Interpretation:
    - Analyze which features most influence house prices and present insights.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Compare feature importance scores from SHAP with those from traditional methods like permutation importance.
- Create interactive visualizations using SHAP's built-in plotting functions.

### Project 2: Customer Churn Prediction with SHAP Insights
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)

**Project Objective**: Develop a model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company and use SHAP to interpret the model's predictions.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Telco Customer Churn dataset, available on Kaggle: [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

**Tasks**:
- Data Exploration:
    - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer features and churn rates.
- Model Development:
    - Build a Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict churn.
- SHAP Analysis:
    - Calculate SHAP values to assess the importance of different customer features in the churn prediction.
- Insights Presentation:
    - Summarize findings and suggest actionable strategies for reducing churn based on SHAP insights.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Implement a baseline model (e.g., Logistic Regression) for comparison and discuss differences in interpretability.
- Explore interaction effects between features using SHAP interaction values.

### Project 3: Credit Scoring Model with SHAP for Interpretability
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: Build a credit scoring model to assess the risk of loan default and use SHAP to provide interpretable insights into the model's predictions.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- German Credit dataset, available on UCI Machine Learning Repository: [German Credit Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data))

**Tasks**:
- Data Preparation:
    - Clean and preprocess the dataset, including feature engineering and encoding categorical variables.
- Model Training:
    - Train an XGBoost classifier to predict credit risk.
- SHAP Implementation:
    - Use SHAP to analyze feature contributions and visualize the results.
- Risk Assessment:
    - Discuss the implications of the findings for credit scoring and risk management.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics (AUC, confusion matrix) and compare with SHAP feature importance.
- Conduct a sensitivity analysis to understand how changes in key features affect predictions and risk assessments.
