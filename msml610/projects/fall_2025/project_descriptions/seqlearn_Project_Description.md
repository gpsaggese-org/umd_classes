**Description**

Seqlearn is a Python library designed for sequence learning tasks, particularly focused on supervised learning methods for sequence data. It provides tools for training and evaluating sequence models, including Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). 

Key Features:
- Implements CRFs and HMMs for sequence labeling tasks.
- Supports various optimization techniques for model training.
- Allows for easy integration with scikit-learn for preprocessing and evaluation.

### Project 1: Named Entity Recognition (Difficulty: 1 - Easy)

**Project Objective:**
Develop a named entity recognition (NER) system that identifies and classifies named entities (e.g., persons, organizations, locations) in a text corpus.

**Dataset Suggestions:**
- Use the "CoNLL 2003 Named Entity Recognition" dataset available on Kaggle: [CoNLL 2003 NER Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavpoudel/conll-2003-ner-dataset).

**Tasks:**
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Load and clean the dataset, converting it into a suitable format for seqlearn.
- Feature Engineering:
    - Extract features such as word embeddings, part-of-speech tags, and character-level features.
- Model Training:
    - Train a CRF model using seqlearn on the annotated dataset.
- Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization:
    - Visualize the performance and results using confusion matrices and classification reports.

### Project 2: Time Series Anomaly Detection (Difficulty: 2 - Medium)

**Project Objective:**
Detect anomalies in time series data from sensor readings to identify unusual patterns that may indicate system failures or irregularities.

**Dataset Suggestions:**
- Use the "NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation" dataset available on Kaggle: [NASA Turbofan Engine Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behnamf/engine-failure-prediction).

**Tasks:**
- Data Preparation:
    - Load the dataset and preprocess the time series data for modeling.
- Sequence Segmentation:
    - Segment the time series into sequences suitable for anomaly detection.
- Feature Extraction:
    - Engineer features such as rolling averages and differences between consecutive readings.
- Model Training:
    - Train a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using seqlearn to learn normal behavior patterns.
- Anomaly Detection:
    - Use the trained model to identify anomalies in the test dataset and evaluate the results.
- Reporting:
    - Create a report detailing the detected anomalies and their potential causes.

### Project 3: Speech Emotion Recognition (Difficulty: 3 - Hard)

**Project Objective:**
Build a model to classify emotions in speech signals based on audio features extracted from audio recordings.

**Dataset Suggestions:**
- Use the "RAVDESS Emotion Speech Audio" dataset available on Kaggle: [RAVDESS Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio).

**Tasks:**
- Data Collection:
    - Load the audio files and their corresponding emotion labels from the dataset.
- Audio Feature Extraction:
    - Extract features from audio signals using libraries like librosa (e.g., MFCCs, chroma features).
- Sequence Preparation:
    - Convert the extracted features into sequences that can be fed into seqlearn.
- Model Training:
    - Train a CRF model using seqlearn for emotion classification based on the sequences.
- Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
- Advanced Analysis:
    - Analyze the impact of different audio features on emotion classification performance and visualize the results.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional):**
- For Project 1: Experiment with different feature sets or add a deep learning model as a baseline comparison.
- For Project 2: Implement a more sophisticated anomaly detection method, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN), and compare results.
- For Project 3: Explore transfer learning techniques by leveraging pre-trained models on audio data to improve performance.
