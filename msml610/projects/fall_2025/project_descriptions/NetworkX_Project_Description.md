**Description**

In this project, students will utilize NetworkX, a powerful Python library for the creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks. It provides tools to analyze the structure and dynamics of networks, making it ideal for tasks involving graph theory and network analysis. The library supports a range of features including:

- Creation and manipulation of both undirected and directed graphs.
- Algorithms for shortest paths, clustering, and centrality measures.
- Visualization capabilities to represent networks graphically.

### Project 1: Social Network Analysis of Twitter Interactions (Difficulty: 1)

**Project Objective**: The goal of this project is to analyze the social interactions within a Twitter network to identify key influencers based on their connections and engagement levels.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the Twitter API to collect tweets using a specific hashtag (e.g., #DataScience). Alternatively, the "Twitter Social Network" dataset is available on Kaggle.

**Tasks**:
- **Data Collection**: Use the Twitter API to gather tweets and user interactions (retweets, likes).
- **Graph Construction**: Create a directed graph where nodes represent users and edges represent interactions (retweets, mentions).
- **Centrality Analysis**: Calculate centrality measures (degree, closeness, betweenness) to identify key influencers in the network.
- **Visualization**: Use NetworkX to visualize the social network, highlighting influential users with distinct colors or sizes.

### Project 2: Analyzing the Spread of Information in a News Network (Difficulty: 2)

**Project Objective**: The objective of this project is to model and analyze how information spreads through a network of news articles and their citations.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Citations of Scientific Papers" dataset available on Kaggle, which includes citations between papers.

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the citation data to extract relevant information (article titles, citations).
- **Graph Representation**: Construct a directed graph where nodes are articles and edges represent citations.
- **Community Detection**: Apply community detection algorithms (e.g., Girvan-Newman) to identify clusters of articles that are frequently cited together.
- **Information Propagation Simulation**: Simulate the spread of information through the network using a diffusion model (e.g., Independent Cascade Model).
- **Visualization**: Visualize the network and the identified communities using NetworkX and Matplotlib.

### Project 3: Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions (Difficulty: 3)

**Project Objective**: The aim of this project is to detect fraudulent transactions in a financial network by analyzing the relationships between users and their transaction behaviors.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset available on Kaggle, which contains anonymized transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preparation**: Preprocess the dataset to create a graph representation of transactions, where nodes are users and edges represent transactions between them.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Implement algorithms to identify unusual patterns, such as unusually high transaction volumes or connections to known fraudulent accounts.
- **Network Properties Analysis**: Calculate network properties (e.g., clustering coefficients, average path length) to understand the structure of the transaction network.
- **Fraud Detection Algorithm**: Develop a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) that uses network features (like centrality measures) to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
- **Visualization**: Use NetworkX to visualize the transaction network, highlighting fraudulent transactions and their connections.

**Bonus Ideas**: 
- For Project 1, explore sentiment analysis on tweets to correlate influencer activity with public sentiment.
- For Project 2, extend the analysis to track how information evolves over time by adding a temporal component to the graph.
- For Project 3, consider integrating external data sources (e.g., social media profiles) to enhance fraud detection capabilities.
