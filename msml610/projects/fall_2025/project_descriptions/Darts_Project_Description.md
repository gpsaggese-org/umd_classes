### Project 1: Sales Forecasting for Retail Products  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: The goal of this project is to build a forecasting model to predict future sales of a retail product based on historical sales data, optimizing for accuracy in the predictions.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: "Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge" available on Kaggle.  
- **Link**: [Store Item Demand Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/demand-forecasting-kernels-only/data)

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Ingestion**: Load the sales dataset using Pandas and prepare it for analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, and perform time series decomposition to understand seasonality and trends.
- **Model Selection**: Use Darts to implement a simple forecasting model like ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing.
- **Model Evaluation**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, then evaluate the model using metrics such as MAE or RMSE.
- **Forecasting**: Generate future sales predictions and visualize them using Darts' plotting functionalities.

### Project 2: Energy Consumption Forecasting  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: The objective is to forecast energy consumption for a city based on historical consumption patterns, optimizing for the model that provides the best predictions.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: "Household Electric Power Consumption" available on UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
- **Link**: [Household Electric Power Consumption](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/household+electric+power+consumption)

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Ingestion**: Load the dataset and parse date-time information for time series analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create additional features such as day of the week, month, and lagged values to improve the model.
- **Model Comparison**: Use Darts to compare multiple forecasting models (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) to find the best fit for the data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the models using cross-validation techniques to improve forecasting accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Plot the predicted vs. actual energy consumption to analyze model performance.

### Project 3: Stock Price Prediction using News Sentiment  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: The goal of this project is to predict stock prices by integrating historical price data with sentiment analysis from news articles, optimizing for predictive accuracy.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: "Yahoo Finance Historical Stock Prices" for stock data.  
- **Link**: Use the Yahoo Finance API (free tier) to fetch historical stock prices.  
- **News Sentiment**: Use the "Financial News Dataset" available on Kaggle for sentiment analysis.  
- **Link**: [Financial News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sbhatti/financial-news-dataset)

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Ingestion**: Fetch historical stock prices using the Yahoo Finance API and load news data from Kaggle.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Use a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (e.g., VADER) to analyze the sentiment of news articles related to the stock.
- **Data Merging**: Combine the sentiment scores with stock price data, aligning them based on dates.
- **Model Implementation**: Use Darts to implement advanced forecasting models (e.g., LSTM) that take both historical prices and sentiment data as input.
- **Evaluation and Analysis**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like MAPE and visualize the impact of sentiment on stock price predictions.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Explore the impact of different news sources on sentiment and stock price predictions.  
- Implement ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models.  
- Investigate the effects of macroeconomic indicators on stock price forecasting.
