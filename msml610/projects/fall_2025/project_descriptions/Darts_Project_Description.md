## Project 1: Sales Forecasting for Retail Products  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  

**Project Objective**: Build a forecasting model to predict future sales of a retail product based on historical sales data, optimizing for accuracy in the predictions.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: "Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge" on Kaggle  
- **Link**: [Store Item Demand Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/demand-forecasting-kernels-only/data)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Ingestion**: Load the sales dataset using Pandas and prepare it for analysis.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values and perform time series decomposition to understand seasonality and trends.  
- **Model Selection**: Use Darts to implement a simple forecasting model like ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, then evaluate the model using metrics such as MAE or RMSE.  
- **Forecasting**: Generate future sales predictions and visualize them using Darts' plotting functionalities.

## Project 2: Energy Consumption Forecasting  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  

**Project Objective**: Forecast energy consumption for a region based on historical usage patterns, optimizing for the model that provides the most accurate multi-step forecasts.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: "PJME Hourly Energy Consumption" available on Kaggle  
- **Link**: [PJME Hourly Energy Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Ingestion**: Load the dataset and parse date-time information for time series analysis.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Create additional features such as day of the week, month, lagged values, and rolling averages to improve model performance.  
- **Model Comparison**: Use Darts to compare multiple forecasting models (e.g., Prophet, NBEATS, LSTM) to find the best fit for the data.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the models using grid search and cross-validation to improve forecasting accuracy.  
- **Visualization**: Plot predicted vs. actual energy consumption to analyze performance across different time windows.

## Project 3: Stock Price Prediction using News Sentiment  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  

**Project Objective**: Predict stock prices by integrating historical price data with sentiment analysis from financial news, optimizing for predictive accuracy in a multivariate setting.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Stock Data**: Use the `yfinance` Python library to fetch historical stock prices (free and widely used).  
- **News Sentiment**: Use the "Financial News Dataset" available on Kaggle.  
- **Link**: [Financial News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sbhatti/financial-news-dataset)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Ingestion**: Fetch historical stock prices using the `yfinance` library and load financial news data from Kaggle.  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Use a pre-trained sentiment model (e.g., VADER or FinBERT) to extract sentiment scores from news articles.  
- **Data Merging**: Align sentiment scores with stock prices based on dates to create a combined multivariate time series.  
- **Model Implementation**: Use Darts to implement advanced forecasting models (e.g., LSTM, NBEATS) that handle both price data and sentiment features.  
- **Evaluation and Analysis**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like MAPE, visualize results, and analyze how sentiment influences price predictions.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Experiment with multivariate vs. univariate forecasting to measure sentimentâ€™s added value.  
- Implement ensemble methods to combine forecasts from ARIMA, Prophet, and deep learning models.  
- Add macroeconomic indicators (e.g., interest rates, inflation indexes) as extra regressors in the multivariate model.
