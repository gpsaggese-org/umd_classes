**Description**

The What-If Tool (WIT) is an interactive visualization tool designed to help users analyze machine learning models without requiring extensive programming knowledge. It provides a user-friendly interface for exploring model performance, feature importance, and the effects of different input values on predictions. WIT allows for easy comparison of model behavior and helps identify potential biases or weaknesses in the model.

Technologies Used
What-If Tool (WIT)

- Provides a visual interface for model analysis and evaluation.
- Enables users to manipulate input features and observe changes in predictions.
- Supports various machine learning frameworks, including TensorFlow and scikit-learn.
- Facilitates the exploration of model performance metrics and feature importance.

### Project 1: Predicting House Prices
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: Develop a regression model to predict house prices based on various features (e.g., size, location, number of bedrooms) and evaluate the model's performance using WIT.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- "Ames Housing Dataset" available on Kaggle: [Ames Housing](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prestonvong/AmesHousing)

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing:
  - Load and clean the Ames Housing dataset, handling missing values and categorical variables.
  
- Feature Engineering:
  - Create new features based on existing ones (e.g., total square footage).
  
- Model Training:
  - Train a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression) to predict house prices.
  
- WIT Integration:
  - Use WIT to visualize model predictions and feature importance.
  
- Performance Evaluation:
  - Analyze the model's performance metrics (e.g., RMSE) and explore how changes in features affect predictions.

### Project 2: Customer Churn Prediction
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: Build a classification model to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company and analyze the model's behavior using WIT.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- "Telco Customer Churn" dataset on Kaggle: [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

**Tasks**:
- Data Exploration:
  - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer features and churn rates.
  
- Data Preprocessing:
  - Clean the data and encode categorical features appropriately.
  
- Model Training:
  - Train a classification model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict churn.
  
- WIT Visualization:
  - Utilize WIT to explore the impact of customer features on churn predictions.
  
- Sensitivity Analysis:
  - Investigate how altering feature values affects the likelihood of churn and identify key drivers of customer retention.

### Project 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: Create an anomaly detection model to identify fraudulent transactions in credit card data and utilize WIT to analyze model performance and decision boundaries.

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset on Kaggle: [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dalpozz/creditcard-fraud)

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing:
  - Preprocess the dataset by normalizing features and addressing class imbalance using techniques such as SMOTE.
  
- Model Selection:
  - Choose and train an anomaly detection model (e.g., Isolation Forest or Autoencoder) for fraud detection.
  
- WIT Analysis:
  - Implement WIT to visualize the decision boundaries and explore false positives and false negatives.
  
- Performance Evaluation:
  - Assess model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, and analyze the model's behavior with WIT.
  
- Feature Impact Exploration:
  - Use WIT to manipulate feature values and evaluate how these changes affect fraud detection outcomes.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- For Project 1, compare different regression algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting) using WIT.
- For Project 2, implement a cost-sensitive approach to minimize churn-related costs and analyze results with WIT.
- For Project 3, develop an ensemble model combining multiple anomaly detection techniques and analyze its performance with WIT.
