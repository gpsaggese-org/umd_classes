**Description**

Opacus is a powerful library designed for training PyTorch models with differential privacy, allowing data scientists to build machine learning models that protect individual data points while still enabling effective learning. It provides features such as:

- **Differential Privacy**: Ensures that the model does not memorize individual data points, safeguarding user privacy.
- **Easy Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing PyTorch models and training workflows.
- **Customizable Privacy Parameters**: Allows users to adjust privacy budgets and noise levels based on their requirements.
- **Support for Various Model Types**: Can be applied to different types of machine learning tasks, including classification and regression.

### Project 3: Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: Create a time series forecasting model for predicting stock prices using historical data while ensuring the privacy of individual data points through differential privacy.

**Dataset Suggestions**:
- Yahoo Finance historical stock prices (free to access via yfinance library): [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)

**Tasks**:
- Data Collection:
  - Use the yfinance library to gather historical stock price data for a specific company (e.g., Apple Inc.).

- Data Preprocessing:
  - Clean and preprocess the time series data, including normalization and feature engineering.

- Model Development:
  - Implement a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for time series forecasting.

- Differential Privacy Application:
  - Integrate Opacus to introduce differential privacy into the training process, focusing on maintaining the privacy of historical prices.

- Forecasting and Evaluation:
  - Train the model and forecast future stock prices, evaluating performance using metrics such as RMSE and MAE.

**Bonus Ideas**: 
- Compare the performance of different forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA vs. LSTM).
- Analyze the effects of adding noise on the model's forecasting accuracy.
