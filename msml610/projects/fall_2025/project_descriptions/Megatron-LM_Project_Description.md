**Description**

Megatron-LM is a framework optimized for training and fine-tuning large-scale transformer-based language models. It is designed for scalability, leveraging model parallelism to handle models with billions of parameters. By combining mixed-precision training, GPU/TPU acceleration, and pre-trained checkpoints, Megatron-LM enables researchers and practitioners to efficiently explore advanced NLP tasks. Its strengths include:

- **Model Parallelism**: Efficiently distributes massive models across multiple GPUs.
- **Mixed Precision Training**: Reduces memory usage and accelerates training without loss of accuracy.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Provides access to powerful pre-trained checkpoints for downstream tasks.
- **Scalability**: Supports handling very large datasets and architectures beyond typical frameworks.

### Project 1: Abstractive Text Summarization

- **Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)
- **Project Objective**: Fine-tune a pre-trained Megatron-LM model to generate abstractive summaries of news articles, optimizing for ROUGE scores.  
- **Dataset Suggestions**: ["CNN/Daily Mail"](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail) dataset on Hugging Face.  
- **Tasks**:
  - Load and preprocess the dataset (article-summary pairs).
  - Use Megatron-LMâ€™s pre-trained checkpoint and fine-tune with low-resource techniques (e.g., adapters or LoRA).
  - Generate summaries for unseen articles.
  - Evaluate results with ROUGE metrics.
- **Bonus Ideas**: Compare abstractive vs extractive summarization. Deploy a simple web app where users can input an article to receive a summary.

### Project 2: Sentiment Classification of Movie Reviews

- **Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)
- **Project Objective**: Build a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative by fine-tuning Megatron-LM.  
- **Dataset Suggestions**: ["IMDb Movie Reviews"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) dataset on Kaggle.  
- **Tasks**:
  - Preprocess the reviews (cleaning + tokenization).
  - Fine-tune a pre-trained Megatron-LM checkpoint for binary classification.
  - Evaluate model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - (Optional) Compare with smaller transformer models (e.g., BERT) for efficiency trade-offs.
- **Bonus Ideas**: Extend to multi-class classification (positive/negative/neutral). Visualize attention weights to interpret model decisions.

### Project 3: Topic Discovery in News Articles using Embeddings

- **Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)
- **Project Objective**: Use Megatron-LM embeddings to discover and cluster latent topics in large collections of news articles.  
- **Dataset Suggestions**: ["20 Newsgroups"](https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html) dataset from scikit-learn, or articles from the [NewsAPI free tier](https://newsapi.org/).  
- **Tasks**:
  - Collect and preprocess a corpus of news articles.
  - Generate sentence or document embeddings using Megatron-LM.
  - Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, hierarchical clustering) on embeddings to identify topics.
  - Visualize topic clusters and top keywords.
  - Compare results with classical topic modeling (e.g., LDA).
- **Bonus Ideas**: Track topic distributions over time to analyze trends. Build an interactive dashboard for topic exploration.
