**Description**

LiNGAM (Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model) is a statistical method for causal inference that allows researchers to identify causal relationships from observational data. It is particularly useful for discovering the structure of causal graphs and understanding the underlying mechanisms of data generation. 

Technologies Used
LiNGAM

- Estimates causal relationships between variables using non-Gaussianity.
- Capable of identifying the direction of causal influence.
- Works with continuous and discrete data types.

### Project 1: Causal Analysis of Economic Indicators
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: 
Analyze the causal relationships between various economic indicators (e.g., GDP, unemployment rate, inflation) to understand how they influence each other.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "U.S. Economic Indicators" dataset available on Kaggle: [U.S. Economic Indicators](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benroshan/economic-indicators).

**Tasks**:
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Clean and format the dataset for analysis.
    - Handle missing values and outliers appropriately.
  
- Apply LiNGAM:
    - Implement the LiNGAM algorithm to identify causal relationships between economic indicators.
  
- Visualize Causal Graph:
    - Use network visualization libraries (e.g., NetworkX, Graphviz) to illustrate the causal graph.

- Interpret Results:
    - Analyze the causal relationships and discuss their implications for economic policy.

### Project 2: Causal Impact of Environmental Factors on Health Outcomes
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)

**Project Objective**: 
Investigate the causal impact of environmental factors (e.g., air quality, temperature, and humidity) on public health outcomes such as respiratory diseases.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Air Quality" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Air Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality).

**Tasks**:
- Data Integration:
    - Merge air quality data with health outcome data from public health sources (e.g., CDC).

- Feature Engineering:
    - Create relevant features from raw data, such as average air quality index over time.

- Apply LiNGAM:
    - Use the LiNGAM algorithm to determine causal relationships between environmental factors and health outcomes.

- Evaluate Causal Strength:
    - Assess the strength and significance of the identified causal relationships.

- Report Findings:
    - Present findings in a report, discussing potential public health interventions based on the analysis.

### Project 3: Understanding the Causal Structure of Customer Behavior in E-commerce
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: 
Uncover the causal structure of customer behavior in an e-commerce setting, focusing on how different factors (e.g., website design, product recommendations, pricing) influence purchasing decisions.

**Dataset Suggestions**: 
- Use the "Online Retail" dataset available on UCI: [Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail).

**Tasks**:
- Data Preparation:
    - Clean the dataset, focusing on customer transactions and relevant features.

- Exploratory Data Analysis:
    - Conduct EDA to understand patterns in customer behavior and identify potential causal factors.

- Apply LiNGAM:
    - Implement the LiNGAM algorithm to analyze the causal relationships among various factors influencing customer purchases.

- Model Validation:
    - Validate the causal model using techniques such as cross-validation or bootstrapping.

- Business Implications:
    - Discuss how the findings can inform marketing strategies and website design to enhance customer engagement and sales.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- For Project 1, consider comparing the results with traditional correlation analysis to highlight differences.
- For Project 2, explore the impact of additional variables, such as socioeconomic factors, on health outcomes.
- For Project 3, extend the analysis to include customer segmentation and how different segments respond to various influences.
