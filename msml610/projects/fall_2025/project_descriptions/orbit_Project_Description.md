**Description**

Orbit is a Python library designed for analyzing and visualizing time series data, specifically focusing on customer behavior and engagement metrics. It facilitates the modeling of user activity over time, enabling businesses to understand trends, predict future behavior, and optimize marketing strategies. 

Technologies Used
Orbit

- Provides a user-friendly interface for Bayesian modeling of time series data.
- Supports various models including seasonal and non-seasonal components.
- Allows for easy visualization of time series trends and forecasts.
- Facilitates the analysis of user engagement metrics over time.

### Project 1: Customer Engagement Trend Analysis (Difficulty: 1)

**Project Objective**: Analyze customer engagement metrics over time to identify trends and seasonal patterns, optimizing marketing strategies based on these insights.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Online Retail Dataset" available on Kaggle, which contains transactional data of a UK-based online retailer. 

**Tasks**:
- **Data Preparation**: Load the dataset and preprocess it to extract relevant engagement metrics such as purchase frequency and average order value.
- **Time Series Decomposition**: Use Orbit to decompose the time series data into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
- **Visualization**: Create visualizations to illustrate the engagement trends over time.
- **Forecasting**: Implement simple forecasting models to predict future engagement metrics.
- **Insights Report**: Generate a report summarizing trends and actionable insights for marketing strategies.

### Project 2: Churn Prediction with Time Series Analysis (Difficulty: 2)

**Project Objective**: Predict customer churn by analyzing historical engagement data and identifying patterns that lead to customer drop-off.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset from Kaggle, which includes customer information and service usage metrics.

**Tasks**:
- **Data Cleaning**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to focus on customer engagement metrics over time.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create time-based features (e.g., usage frequency, last engagement date) that may correlate with churn.
- **Modeling with Orbit**: Utilize Orbit to model customer engagement over time and identify potential churn signals.
- **Churn Prediction**: Implement a classification model (e.g., logistic regression) that uses the output from the time series model as features to predict churn.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

**Bonus Ideas**: Explore additional features like customer demographics or service plans to enhance the model's predictive power.

### Project 3: Demand Forecasting for E-commerce (Difficulty: 3)

**Project Objective**: Build a robust demand forecasting model for an e-commerce platform using historical sales data and customer behavior metrics.

**Dataset Suggestions**: Use the "Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge" dataset available on Kaggle, which includes historical sales data for various items across different stores.

**Tasks**:
- **Data Exploration**: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand sales patterns, seasonality, and anomalies in the dataset.
- **Time Series Modeling**: Apply Orbit to create a time series model that captures the demand dynamics for different items.
- **Incorporate Exogenous Variables**: Integrate additional features such as promotions, holidays, and marketing campaigns into the model to improve forecasts.
- **Forecast Evaluation**: Validate the model using back-testing techniques and assess accuracy with metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Visualization of Results**: Visualize the forecasted vs. actual demand over time to illustrate the model's performance.

**Bonus Ideas**: Experiment with different forecasting horizons (short-term vs. long-term) and compare the performance of different models (e.g., ARIMA vs. Orbit).
