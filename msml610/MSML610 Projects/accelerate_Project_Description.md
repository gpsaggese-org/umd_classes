### Project 1: Predicting Housing Prices (Difficulty: 1)
**Project Objective:** The goal of this project is to build a regression model that predicts housing prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. 

**Dataset Suggestions:** Use a public dataset from Kaggle that includes housing prices and relevant features.

**Step-by-Step Plan:**
1. **Data Collection:** Download the housing price dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Identify and create relevant features (e.g., logarithmic transformations for skewed distributions).
3. **Model Training:** Use a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression or Random Forest) to predict prices.
4. **Use of the Tool:** Implement Accelerate to speed up the training process, especially if using larger datasets.
5. **Evaluation Metrics:** Use RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) to evaluate model performance.
6. **Visualization or Reporting:** Create visualizations to compare predicted vs. actual prices and summarize findings.

**Bonus Ideas:** Explore feature importance using SHAP values or LIME to interpret the model.

### Project 2: Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews (Difficulty: 2)
**Project Objective:** The aim is to develop a machine learning model that classifies product reviews as positive, negative, or neutral based on the text content.

**Dataset Suggestions:** Utilize a sentiment analysis dataset from HuggingFace that contains labeled product reviews.

**Step-by-Step Plan:**
1. **Data Collection:** Access the sentiment analysis dataset via HuggingFace Datasets.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Preprocess text data (tokenization, removing stop words, etc.) and create embeddings using pre-trained models.
3. **Model Training:** Fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., BERT) for sentiment classification.
4. **Use of the Tool:** Utilize Accelerate to enhance training speed and efficiency when fine-tuning the model.
5. **Evaluation Metrics:** Use accuracy and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
6. **Visualization or Reporting:** Create word clouds or confusion matrices to visualize sentiment distribution and model performance.

**Bonus Ideas:** Experiment with different transformer architectures or perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy.

### Project 3: Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic (Difficulty: 3)
**Project Objective:** The goal is to detect anomalies in network traffic data that could indicate potential security threats or system failures.

**Dataset Suggestions:** Use a publicly available dataset from Kaggle containing network traffic logs with labeled anomalies.

**Step-by-Step Plan:**
1. **Data Collection:** Download the network traffic dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features (e.g., packet sizes, connection durations) and normalize the data.
3. **Model Training:** Implement an unsupervised learning approach, such as Isolation Forest or Autoencoders, for anomaly detection.
4. **Use of the Tool:** Leverage Accelerate to efficiently process large datasets and speed up model training.
5. **Evaluation Metrics:** Use precision, recall, and the F1-score to evaluate the effectiveness of the anomaly detection model.
6. **Visualization or Reporting:** Visualize detected anomalies over time and provide a report on the patterns observed.

**Bonus Ideas:** Investigate the impact of different feature sets on model performance or conduct an analysis of false positives and negatives to refine the model further.
