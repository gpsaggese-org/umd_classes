description: Write a conference paper draft from a research idea
model: opus
--- 

# Goal
- Given a research idea, write a full conference paper draft using the template
  in `papers/template/`

# Workflow

## Read Inputs
- Read the research idea passed by the user (a file under
  `research/ideas/*.md`, e.g. `research/ideas/in_progress.RL_for_auto_EDA.md`,
  or idea text pasted directly)
- Read the paper template `papers/template/paper.md`, including the comment
  block at the top, for usage and section structure
- Read an existing paper for style and depth, e.g.
  `papers/Optimal_strategy_for_racket_sports/paper.md`

## Set Up the Paper Directory
- Derive a short Title_Case name for the paper from the idea (e.g.
  `RL_for_Automated_EDA`); ask the user if the idea does not suggest an
  obvious name
- Create `papers/<Paper_Name>/` if it does not exist
- Copy `Makefile`, `references.bib`, `ieee-template.typ`, and `figures/`
  from `papers/template/` into the new directory
- Do not overwrite an existing `paper.md` without confirming with the user

## Write `paper.md`
- Fill in every `<...>` placeholder with content derived from the idea:
  title, author(s) (use the assignee(s) listed in
  `research/ideas/README.md` for this idea, plus GP Saggese), abstract,
  keywords, and all body sections
- Keep the template's section structure (Introduction, Related Work,
  Problem Formulation, core methodology, Discussion/Limitations,
  Conclusion); add, remove, or rename sections only where the template
  says it's allowed
- Turn the idea's "Core Idea", "Formalization", "Key Examples", and
  "Research Topics" into the Introduction and Problem Formulation sections
- Turn the idea's "Questions" and "Next steps" into Discussion/Limitations
  and Conclusion/Future Work material
- State plainly, per the template, what has not been validated (e.g. no
  computational implementation or empirical evaluation) instead of
  fabricating results the idea does not support
- Delete the template's guidance bullets and HTML comment once replaced
  with real content

## Conventions
- Follow the conventions in `.claude/skills/markdown.rules.md` and
  `.claude/skills/text.rules.md`
- Fit text in 80-90 character lines
- Cite claims with `[@key]` and add matching entries to `references.bib`

## Verify
- Run `make` in the new paper directory to confirm `paper.md` builds to
  `paper.pdf` without errors
