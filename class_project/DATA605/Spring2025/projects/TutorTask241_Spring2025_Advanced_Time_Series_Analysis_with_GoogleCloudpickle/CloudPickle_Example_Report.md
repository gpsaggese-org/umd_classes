**Data Storage:**
- Raw fetched data serialized to: `raw_btc_data_30d_example.pkl`
- Final analyzed data (with SMAs) serialized to: `analyzed_btc_data_30d_example.pkl`

**Note on Cloudpickle & Distributed Processing:**
The calculation of one of the SMAs was performed using Python's `multiprocessing` module. `cloudpickle` was essential for this, as it allowed the serialization of the `calculate_moving_average` function and Pandas DataFrame chunks to be passed to, and results returned from, separate worker processes. This demonstrates `cloudpickle`'s utility in enabling more complex, distributed Python workflows.
