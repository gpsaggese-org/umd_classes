#  Real-Time Bitcoin Price Forecasting with PyCaret




### **Project Overview**  


This project implements an end-to-end automated machine learning pipeline for real-time Bitcoin price forecasting using PyCaret, an open-source low-code machine learning library. The system connects to cryptocurrency APIs (CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap) to fetch live Bitcoin price data at regular intervals, processes the data using pandas, and leverages PyCaretâ€™s specialized time series module to train, compare, and deploy forecasting models. The goal is to demonstrate how PyCaretâ€™s automated ML capabilities can simplify complex time series analysis tasks while maintaining robustness in volatile market conditions.  

The workflow begins with real-time data ingestion, where Pythonâ€™s `requests` library fetches OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) price data and trading volume from cryptocurrency APIs. This data undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, normalize timestamps, and engineer relevant features like moving averages and relative strength index (RSI). PyCaret then automates the entire model development lifecycleâ€”splitting the data into training and validation sets (using time-series-specific cross-validation), testing multiple algorithms, and selecting the best-performing model based on metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error). The selected model generates price predictions for future time horizons with confidence intervals, which are visualized interactively using Plotly.  

A key innovation of this project is its Dockerized environment, which ensures reproducibility across systems. The container includes all dependencies (PyCaret, pandas, Plotly) and scripts to fetch data, run forecasts, and update visualizations automatically. This setup is particularly valuable for financial analysis, where model performance can degrade rapidly due to market volatility, requiring frequent retraining. By combining PyCaretâ€™s low-code efficiency with real-time data pipelines, the project offers a template for rapid prototyping of time series models in finance.  


### 1. **PyCaret API Exploration (`pycaret.API.ipynb`)**  

  -  **Setup Validation**: PyCaret time series experiment initialized with `fh=24` (24-hour forecast horizon) and no errors in data loading.  
  -  **Model Comparison**: At least 3 models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, Exponential Smoothing) compared with RMSE < 500 USD (benchmark for Bitcoinâ€™s volatility).  


### 2. **Bitcoin Forecasting Example (`bitcoin.example.ipynb`)**  
 
  -  **Data Ingestion**: Real-time data fetched from CoinGecko API with:  
    - Columns: `timestamp`, `price`, `volume` (no missing values).  
    - Updated every 1 hour (cron job logic in `bitcoin_utils.py`).  
  -  **Visualization**: Interactive Plotly chart showing:  
    - Historical prices (30-day window).  
    - Predicted values with confidence interval (e.g., `plotly.express.line`).  
  -  **Deployment**: Docker container runs end-to-end without errors (`docker_jupyter.sh` launches notebook).
