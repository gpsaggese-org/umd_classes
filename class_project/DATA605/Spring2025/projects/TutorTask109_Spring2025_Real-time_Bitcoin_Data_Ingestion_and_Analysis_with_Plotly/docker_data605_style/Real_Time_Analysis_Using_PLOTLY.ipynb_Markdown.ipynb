    "## `Real_Time_Analysis_Using_PLOTLY.ipynb` â€” Real-Time Visualization of Bitcoin Blockchain Metrics in a Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a **real-time data visualization tool** using Python and Plotly. It fetches live Bitcoin blockchain metrics like transaction count, block size, and hash rate, and visualizes them with rolling averages, anomaly detection, and seasonal decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Will Learn\n",
    "- How to collect live blockchain data using an API  \n",
    "- How to clean and process time series data  \n",
    "- How to calculate rolling mean, standard deviation, and Z-scores  \n",
    "- How to perform time series decomposition (trend, seasonal, residual)  \n",
    "- How to create multi-panel interactive plots using Plotly  \n",
    "- How to use Python threading for real-time updates in a Jupyter environment  \n",
    "- How to control the analysis with widgets (buttons, sliders)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Code Structure and Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Import Required Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd, numpy as np\n",
    "import plotly.graph_objs as go, plotly.express as px\n",
    "from plotly.subplots import make_subplots\n",
    "from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose\n",
    "from datetime import datetime\n",
    "import time, threading\n",
    "from IPython.display import display\n",
    "import ipywidgets as widgets\n",
    "from template_API import fetch_bitcoin_metric\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These libraries are used for:\n",
    "- Data handling and math: `pandas`, `numpy`  \n",
    "- Plotting: `plotly.graph_objs`, `plotly.subplots`, `plotly.express`  \n",
    "- Time series analysis: `seasonal_decompose`  \n",
    "- Real-time handling: `threading`, `time`  \n",
    "- Widget interface: `ipywidgets`  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Define `BitcoinMetricsAnalyzer` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "This class does the full pipeline work:\n",
    "- Fetches Bitcoin metrics from API  \n",
    "- Cleans the data (interpolation, rolling mean, z-scores)  \n",
    "- Performs seasonal decomposition  \n",
    "- Creates multi-metric visualizations in subplots  \n",
    "- Detects anomalies and updates the plot live  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Fetching and Processing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fetch_bitcoin_metric(metric)\n",
    "df[\"value\"].interpolate()\n",
    "df[\"rolling_mean\"], df[\"rolling_std\"], df[\"z_score\"]\n",
    "seasonal_decompose(df[\"value\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each metric is cleaned and enhanced with additional columns:\n",
    "- `rolling_mean`: smooths the curve  \n",
    "- `z_score`: used to find anomalies  \n",
    "- `trend`, `seasonal`, `residual`: for decomposition  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Creating Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "make_subplots(...)  \n",
    "go.Scatter(...)  \n",
    "go.Heatmap(...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple subplots are created:\n",
    "- Transaction count, hash rate, block size with their rolling averages  \n",
    "- Correlation heatmap  \n",
    "- Trend, seasonal, and residual views  \n",
    "- Highlighting anomalies where z-score > 2  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Real-Time Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "threading.Thread(target=self._update_loop)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook supports real-time updates by running a background thread. It fetches new data at fixed intervals and updates the visualization accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Interactive Widget Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "widgets.SelectMultiple, widgets.IntSlider, widgets.Button\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Widgets are used to:\n",
    "- Select which metrics to show  \n",
    "- Adjust update frequency  \n",
    "- Start and stop the update loop  \n",
    "- Save the current visualization to HTML  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a powerful example of how to:\n",
    "- Combine live API data with advanced visualization  \n",
    "- Structure Python code with object-oriented programming  \n",
    "- Build interactive dashboards directly inside a Jupyter environment  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is ideal for students and analysts interested in cryptocurrency, data visualization, and time series analytics."
