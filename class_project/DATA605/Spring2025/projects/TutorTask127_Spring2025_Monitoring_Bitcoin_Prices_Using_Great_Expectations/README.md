## Project Overview

This project, titled **Monitoring Bitcoin Prices Using Great Expectations**, was developed as part of **TutorTask127 in Spring 2025**.  
It focuses on building a real-time data ingestion and validation pipeline for cryptocurrency price monitoring.  
The system fetches live Bitcoin price data from the **CoinGecko API**, validates each snapshot using **Great Expectations**, and conducts **volatility analysis** and **short-term price forecasting** using statistical methods.  

The architecture is modular, with Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks organized to clearly separate ingestion, validation, and post-validation analysis workflows.

This modular architecture ensures both robustness and flexibility in real-time crypto monitoring.

## Project Files and Dataset

The following files and folders constitute the complete implementation:

- `bitcoin_utils.py` — Core utility functions for fetching, saving, validating, and checking Bitcoin data.
- `bitcoin.API.py` — The `BitcoinAPI` class that integrates all pipeline steps into a reusable ingestion and validation workflow.
- `bitcoin.API.ipynb` — Notebook demonstrating a full data fetch, validation, and doc generation pipeline.
- `bitcoin.API.md` — Full technical documentation for the `BitcoinAPI` class and usage flow.
- `bitcoin.example.py` — The `BitcoinMonitor` class that runs repeated fetches, logs failed validations, analyzes trends, and performs forecasts.
- `bitcoin.example.ipynb` — Notebook for advanced analytics, including z-score anomaly detection and Holt-Winters forecasting.
- `bitcoin.example.md` — Technical breakdown of the monitor logic and post-validation analysis.
- `bitcoin_price_log.csv` — The historical data log containing 6,030 Bitcoin snapshots.
- `README.md` — This file, containing the complete project overview, structure, file guide, and student contact information.

- `logs/` — Folder for error logging:
  - `validation_fail_log.txt` — Logs any validation failures (none were found during the final monitoring session).

- `gx/` — Directory auto-generated by **Great Expectations** after running `great_expectations init`:
  - Stores **expectation suites**, **checkpoints**, and rendered **data documentation**.
  - Final human-readable data quality report (HTML) is located at:  
    `gx/uncommitted/data_docs/local_site/index.html`

- `images/` — Folder containing result visualizations:
  - `bitcoin_trend.jpg` — Real-time price with moving average, z-score volatility bounds, and spike detection.
  - `bitcoin_forecast.jpg` — Short-term Bitcoin price forecast using Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing.

- `docker_data605_style/` — Folder containing all configuration files required to run this project in a Docker container.
  - The key file here is `Dockerfile`, which defines the environment, installs dependencies, and sets up Python, Jupyter, and Great Expectations for full project reproducibility.

## Environment Setting

This project uses a **Docker-based development environment** to ensure clean, reproducible results across different machines.  
To support Great Expectations v0.18.13, we explicitly use **Python 3.10** as the base image to guarantee compatibility with its API and plugin structure.

### Docker Setup Style: data605_style

This project adopts the **data605_style (Simple Docker Environment)**, which follows the same structure as the official **DATA605 tutorials**.  
This version is easy to use and maintain, and it provides a clean environment with only the packages required for the current project.

Note: This setup was chosen over the causify_style for its simplicity and alignment with class tutorial conventions.

### Python and Package Setup

The Dockerfile installs all required packages for ingestion, validation, analytics, and notebook rendering.

| Package         | Version | Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| python          | 3.10    | Base language version; required by Great Expectations v0.18.13         |
| great_expectations | 0.18.13 | Main data validation framework for running expectations and generating Data Docs |
| numpy           | 1.23.5  | Numerical operations, used in preprocessing and statistical summaries   |
| pandas          | 2.1.4   | Core tabular data processing library                                    |
| requests        | 2.31.0  | Used to fetch real-time Bitcoin prices from CoinGecko API              |
| httpx           | 0.27.0  | Optional modern HTTP client (not actively used in this version)        |
| matplotlib      | 3.8.4   | For generating visualizations such as trend plots and forecasts         |
| seaborn         | 0.13.2  | Statistical data visualization built on top of matplotlib              |
| statsmodels     | 0.14.1  | Used for Holt-Winters exponential smoothing and time series forecasting|
| jupyterlab      | 4.1.6   | Provides the notebook interface for running .ipynb tutorials           |

The Docker environment is located under the `docker_data605_style` directory.  
This folder includes everything needed to build and run the containerized development setup tailored to this project.

The `Dockerfile` inside defines all base configurations, including the Python version, required dependencies, Jupyter Lab support, and package installation for analytics and validation.  
It serves as the foundation for running the notebooks, scripts, and Great Expectations validations in a clean and reproducible way.

This approach ensures consistency across machines and avoids version conflicts during grading, deployment, or further experimentation.

## File Usage

For complete guidance on how each component of the system works — including class design, method behavior, validation flow, and output interpretation — please consult the following technical documentation:

- `bitcoin.API.md` — Provides a comprehensive breakdown of the `BitcoinAPI` class, which performs data ingestion, Great Expectations validation, logging, and Data Docs generation. This document walks through each method and its role in the pipeline, making it ideal for understanding the core validation engine.

- `bitcoin.example.md` — Details the `BitcoinMonitor` class used for repeated real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, trend analysis, and short-term price forecasting. It also explains how validation failures are logged, how volatility is measured, and how forecasting is visualized.

These Markdown files serve as the authoritative references for this project and should be reviewed before running or modifying the system.
