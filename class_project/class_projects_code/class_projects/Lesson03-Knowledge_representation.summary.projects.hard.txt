- **Title:** Building a Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Representation System for Medical Diagnosis

- **Difficulty:** Hard

- **Tech description:** 
  Develop a knowledge representation system that integrates symbolic logic with neural network-based reasoning. The system should interpret medical symptoms and suggest potential diagnoses using first-order logic, relational reasoning, and machine learning techniques. 

- **Project idea:** 
  Create a hybrid system that allows users to input symptoms. The system will leverage a medical ontology to represent knowledge and utilize neural networks to process unstructured medical data, bridging the gap between symbolic representation and sub-symbolic perception. The system should be able to answer diagnostic queries based on a knowledge base composed of medical literature.

- **Data set to use:** 
  Use publicly available datasets such as the MIMIC-III Clinical Database or the Disease Ontology dataset which contains symptoms, diseases, and related medical knowledge.

- **Python libs:** 
  - `rdflib` (for ontology handling)
  - `scikit-learn` (for machine learning)
  - `PyTorch` or `TensorFlow` (for deep learning)
  - `SPARQLWrapper` (for querying RDF data)
