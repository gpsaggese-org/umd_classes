# Class Projects
- **Title**: Multi-Paradigm Approach to Fraud Detection 
- **Difficulty**: Hard 
- **Tech description**: Develop a comprehensive fraud detection system employing supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and anomaly detection techniques. Integrate model evaluation and optimization in a structured pipeline.
- **Project idea**: Create a multi-faceted fraud detection application that leverages both supervised models (like Random Forests) to classify known fraudulent transactions and unsupervised methods (like Isolation Forests) to detect anomalies in non-labeled data. Additionally, implement reinforcement learning techniques for adaptive threshold setting based on observed fraud patterns. 
- **Data set to use**: The Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle. (Link: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dalpozz/creditcard-fraud))
- **Python libs**: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn
