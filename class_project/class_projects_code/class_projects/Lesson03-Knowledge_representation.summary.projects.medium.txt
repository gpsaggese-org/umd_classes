- **Title:** Building a Knowledge-Based Chatbot Using Ontologies
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Tech description:** Develop a chatbot that utilizes a knowledge representation in the form of an ontology to answer user queries related to a specific domain (e.g., university course information).
- **Project idea:** Create an interactive chatbot that allows users to ask questions about courses, professors, and departments based on a predefined ontology. The chatbot should utilize logical reasoning to generate responses and handle user queries effectively.
- **Data set to use:** Custom ontology created for a hypothetical university structure, including classes for `Student`, `Professor`, `Course`, and `Department`, along with relationships such as `teaches`, `enrolled_in`, etc.
- **Python libs:**  
  - `rdflib` (for Ontology manipulation)  
  - `Flask` (for the web interface)  
  - `SPARQLWrapper` (for querying RDF data)  
  - `NLTK` or `spaCy` (for natural language processing)  
- **Links to relevant tools:**  
  - [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) (to build and visualize the ontology)  
  - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) (for deploying the application)  
- **Links to related resources:**
