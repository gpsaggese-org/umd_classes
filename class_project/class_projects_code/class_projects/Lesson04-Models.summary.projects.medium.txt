# Class Projects
- **Title:** Weather-Based Outdoor Activity Prediction Using Naive Bayes and Decision Trees
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Tech description:** Students will build a classification model to predict whether children can play outside based on weather-related features. They will implement both Naive Bayes and Decision Tree models for this task.
- **Project idea:** Develop a web application that inputs weather conditions (like outlook, temperature, humidity, and windiness) and outputs a recommendation of whether children should play outside or not. The project will culminate in visualizing decision boundaries of the models used.
- **Data set to use:** The UCI Machine Learning Repository - Weather Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/weather)
- **Python libs:** pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, Flask (for web app)
