## Working on the Project

### Tutorial Goal

For your course project, you are not just building something — you are also
teaching others how to use a Big Data, AI, LLM, or data science technology. The
deliverable is a hands-on, beginner-friendly tutorial that teaches the
technology in 60 minutes.

Each 60-minute tutorial follows this time breakdown for a reader:

1. **Setup (5 min)**: Clone repo, start Docker container, verify environment
2. **Introduction (10 min)**: Read overview markdown, understand use cases
3. **API Exploration (20 min)**: Work through `{project}.API.ipynb` notebook
4. **Complete Example (25 min)**: Work through `{project}.example.ipynb`
   notebook

Each tutorial aims to provide:

- **Conceptual understanding**: Clear explanations of what the technology is and
  when to use it
- **Practical application**: A complete example showing real-world usage and
  working code examples that run immediately
- **Reproducibility**: Guaranteed to work through automated testing with all
  dependencies and setup handled via Docker

### Invariants

All tutorials must maintain these standards:

- **Code repository**: All code is on GitHub in a format common to all tutorials
- **Dependency management**: All packages are handled through Docker in a
  standard approach (e.g., `docker_build`, `docker_bash`)
- **Consistent structure**: The format of the tutorial follows the same
  structure across all topics
- **Centralized location**: All tutorial material is in a directory in the
  [`tutorials`](https://github.com/gpsaggese/umd_classes/tree/master/tutorials)
  repo and in the [`//helpers`](https://github.com/causify-ai/helpers) sub-repo

### Understanding the Deliverables

- Use the example tutorials (e.g., `tutorials/autogen`, `tutorials/tensorflow`)
  and `class_project/project_template` to understand the deliverables and
  coding style. They consist of:

- **Utils Module** (`{project}_utils.py`):
  - Contains helper functions, reusable logic, and wrappers around the tool
  - Keep the notebooks focused on documentation and outputs; place all logic
    inside this module
- **API Notebook** (`{project}.API.ipynb`):
  - Explores the tool's native API: core classes, functions, and configuration
  - Describes the lightweight wrapper layer you have written on top
  - Contains a walkthrough of the library/package with examples
  - Uses simple/synthetic examples since it needs to run quickly
  - Most code should be moved to a `*_utils.py` file
- **Example Notebook** (`{project}.example.ipynb`):
  - Demonstrates an end-to-end application using your wrapper layer
  - Calls functions from `{project}_utils.py` to keep cells concise

In general:

- **For API notebook**: describe the tool's architecture, key abstractions, and
  how your wrapper simplifies it
- **For example notebook**: demonstrate the tool according to the specifications
  in your project description

### Docker Container

- The Docker container should:
  - Contain everything so that one is ready to run tutorials and develop with
    that technology
  - Often installing and getting a package to work (e.g., PyMC) takes a long
    time

- The Docker structure and approach should follow the template
  [`class_project/project_template/`](https://github.com/gpsaggese/umd_classes/tree/master/class_project/project_template)

### Jupyter Notebooks

- Each Jupyter notebook should:
  - Run end-to-end after a restart
    - It's super frustrating when a tutorial doesn't work because the version of
      the library is not compatible with the code anymore
    - This is enforced by the unit test through `pytest`, in this way we are
      guaranteed that it works
  - Be self-contained and linear
    - Each example is explained thoroughly without having to jump from tutorial
      to tutorial
    - Each cell and its output is commented and explained
  - Take less than a few minutes to execute end-to-end

### Markdown

- Markdown documents should cover information about:
  - What the technology/Python package or library is
  - What problem it solves
  - What are the alternatives, both open source and commercial with comments
    about advantages and disadvantages
  - A description of the native API of the technology
  - A description of the Docker container
  - Visual aids with `mermaid`, `graphviz`, `tikz` (e.g., flow diagrams, data
    transformation steps, and plots) to enhance understanding of how the library
    and the example works
  - References to books and in-depth tutorials that we have run and we think are
    awesome
  - All sources should be referred and acknowledged

- This is the same approach used in:
  - [DATA605](https://github.com/gpsaggese/umd_classes/blob/master/data605/tutorials)
    - E.g., Git, Docker, Docker Compose, Postgres, MongoDB, Airflow, Dask, Spark
  - [MSML610](https://github.com/gpsaggese/umd_classes/blob/master/msml610/tutorials/notebooks)

### Tools of the Trade

- Format a markdown file:
  ```bash
  > lint_txt.py -i ...
  ```

- Clean up the Python code using Claude Code:
  ```bash
  cc> Execute docs/ai_prompts/coding.lint.md on tutorials/Autogen/autogen_utils.py
  ```

- Render the blogs locally:
  ```bash
  > website/test.sh
  ```

## Submission

Your submission must include the following files:

- `{project}.API.ipynb`:
  - A `Jupyter` notebook exploring the tool's native API: core classes,
    functions, and configuration
  - Describes the lightweight wrapper layer you have written on top
  - Contains a walkthrough of the library/package with examples
  - Uses simple/synthetic examples so it runs quickly

- `{project}.example.ipynb`:
  - A `Jupyter` notebook demonstrating an end-to-end application
  - Calls functions from `{project}_utils.py` to keep cells concise

- `{project}_utils.py`:
  - A `Python` module containing reusable utility functions and wrappers around
    the package
  - The notebooks should invoke logic from this file instead of embedding
    complex code inline

Organise the tutorial content as follows:

```
tutorials/XYZ/
├── XYZ_utils.py          # All reusable helper functions (no notebook logic)
├── XYZ.API.ipynb         # Paired notebook: native API walkthrough
├── XYZ.API.py            # Jupytext percent-format mirror of the above
├── XYZ.example.ipynb     # Paired notebook: full end-to-end application
├── XYZ.example.py        # Jupytext percent-format mirror of the above
└── artifacts/            # Static files needed by the notebooks (images, etc.)
```

## `XYZ_utils.py`

- Module docstring with `Import as:` line, e.g.:
  ```python
  """
  Utility functions for XYZ-based workflows.

  Import as:

  import tutorials.XYZ.XYZ_utils as txyzuti
  """
  ```
- One `import helpers.hdbg as hdbg` at the top; use `hdbg.dassert` for
  assertions
- Group functions under `# ###...### / # Section name / # ###...###` banners
- Every function has a Google-style docstring with `:param:` and `:return:`
- No notebook-level side effects at module import time (no `input()`, no
  `display()`, no `plt.show()`)

## `XYZ.API.ipynb` / `XYZ.API.py`

- Notebook title cell (markdown): `# XYZ API Overview`
- Brief description of what the technology is and what the notebook covers
- Section structure mirrors the library's own concept hierarchy (Agents,
  Messages, Teams, etc.)
- Each concept has:
  - A markdown cell with a short explanation and bullet-point summary
  - One or more code cells with minimal, runnable examples
  - Comments inside code cells explaining non-obvious lines
- Use synthetic / lightweight examples so the notebook runs in under a few
  minutes
- Import `XYZ_utils` for any helper logic already moved there

## `XYZ.example.ipynb` / `XYZ.example.py`

- Notebook title cell (markdown): `# XYZ: <Application Name>`
- Introduction markdown describing the full application and its workflow
- Top-of-notebook setup cell:
  ```python
  # %load_ext autoreload
  # %autoreload 2
  import logging
  ...
  import XYZ_utils
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
  _LOG = logging.getLogger(__name__)
  ```
- Divided into labelled parts (e.g., `## Part 1: ...`, `## Part 2: ...`)
- Each part has a markdown cell explaining its objective and design decisions
- Heavy logic lives in `XYZ_utils.py`; the notebook only orchestrates and
  displays results
- The notebook must run end-to-end after kernel restart

## Merge Markdown into Notebooks

- Merge markdown files into the corresponding ipynb (a.g., API or example)
  - E.g., `tutorial_asana.md` explaining the API of Asana should be merged into
    `asana.API.ipynb`

## Jupytext pairing

- Every `.ipynb` must be paired with a `.py` file in `percent` format
- The `.py` header:
  ```python
  # ---
  # jupyter:
  #   jupytext:
  #     formats: ipynb,py:percent
  #     text_representation:
  #       extension: .py
  #       format_name: percent
  #       format_version: '1.3'
  #       jupytext_version: 1.19.1
  #   kernelspec:
  #     display_name: Python 3 (ipykernel)
  #     language: python
  #     name: python3
  # ---
  ```

# Step 4: Create a README

- Filename: `README.md`
- Required sections (use the Autogen README as the template):
  1. `# XYZ Tutorial` — one-line description
  2. `## Quick Start` — four bullet points:
     - `cd tutorials/XYZ`
     - `./docker_build.sh`
     - `./docker_jupyter.sh`
     - Ordered list of notebooks to open and what each one covers
  3. Link to the project template README for Docker details

- Keep the README short (< 35 lines); the notebooks are the documentation
