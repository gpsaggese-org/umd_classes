### **Gensim**

**Title**: Real-Time Bitcoin Data Processing with Gensim

**Difficulty**: 3 (difficult)

**Description**  
The project focuses on using Gensim, a powerful Python library to analyze real-time Bitcoin data. Gensim is popular for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, specifically for topic modeling, document similarity, and word embedding. This project will explore Gensim's capabilities in processing time-series data, and students will apply its functionalities to perform complex analyses on Bitcoin price trends. The objective is to ingest real-time Bitcoin data using standard Python packages, transform it using Gensim to draw insights, and implement time-series analysis.

**Describe Technology**

- **Gensim**: Gensim is a robust library designed primarily for topic modeling and document similarity analysis using NLP. Key features include training word2vec, doc2vec models, and creating topic models using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Although Gensim isn't commonly associated with time-series data, its vector space modeling can be ingeniously adapted for this purpose.  
- **Key Functionalities**:  
  - Topic modeling using LDA and LSI  
  - Creating document vectors using Doc2Vec  
  - Word Embedding using Word2Vec and FastText  
  - Efficient Similarity Queries  
- **Use in this Project**:  
  - Transform time-series data (Bitcoin prices) into vector space representation  
  - Identify trends or emerging patterns as "topics" in dataset  
  - Use cosine similarity to compare different time periods

**Describe the Project**

- **Data Ingestion**:  
  - Use Python’s `requests` or `websockets` to fetch real-time Bitcoin data from APIs such as CoinGecko or Binance.  
- **Data Transformation**:  
  - Pre-process the time-series data to convert Bitcoin price changes into a suitable format for analysis  
  - Segment data into suitable time intervals (e.g., 5-minute windows)  
- **Vectorization**:  
  - Use Gensim to transform each data segment into a vector  
  - Analyze these vectors to infer trends, highlighting price volatilities or significant market shifts  
- **Analysis**:  
  - Model the "topics" that are indicative of price dynamics  
  - Use similarity measures to find analogous price movement periods  
- **Outcome**:  
  - Provide comprehensive insights into Bitcoin pricing trends over time

**Is it Free?**  
Yes, Gensim is an open-source library that is completely free to use. Data collection through APIs like CoinGecko or Binance is generally free, though they might have rate limits or require registration for API keys.

**Python Libraries / Bindings**

- **Gensim**: Primary library for modeling and analysis. Installable via `pip install gensim`.  
- **NumPy** and **SciPy**: For numerical computing and any mathematical operations required. Installable with `pip install numpy scipy`.  
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and transforming API response into an analyzable format. Install with `pip install pandas`.  
- **Requests** or **Websockets**: Used for making HTTP requests to API endpoints or establishing WebSocket connections for real-time data. Install using `pip install requests` or `pip install websockets`.
