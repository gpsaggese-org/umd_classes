### Project Description

- **Title:** Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Tech description:** This project involves applying unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers based on purchasing behavior, using K-Means clustering.
- **Project idea:** Utilize K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer groups from a retail dataset. Analyze customer purchasing patterns and develop targeted marketing strategies for each segment.
- **Data set to use:** [Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- **Python libs:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Links to relevant tools:** [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
