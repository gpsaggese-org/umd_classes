### Project Proposal

- **Title:** Weather-based Play Activity Predictor using Naive Bayes
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Tech description:** Develop a predictive model using Naive Bayes to classify whether children will play outside based on various weather parameters.
- **Project idea:** Students will create a model that uses weather data (like temperature, humidity, windiness, and outlook) to predict if kids would play outside. They will learn to preprocess the data, train a Naive Bayes classifier, and evaluate its performance.
- **Data set to use:** UCI Machine Learning Repository - Weather dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/weather)
- **Python libs:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
