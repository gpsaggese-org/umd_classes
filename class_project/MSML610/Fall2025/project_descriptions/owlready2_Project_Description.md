## Description 
Owlready2 is a Python library designed for working with ontologies and knowledge graphs, particularly those formatted in OWL (Web Ontology Language). It allows users to load, manipulate, and query ontologies directly from Python, making it a powerful tool for semantic web applications and knowledge representation.  

**Features:**  
- Load and save OWL ontologies in various formats (RDF/XML, Turtle).  
- Create and manipulate ontology classes, properties, and individuals.  
- Perform reasoning with OWL2 and SPARQL queries.  
- Integrate with Python libraries for ML, analysis, and visualization.

## Project 1: Semantic Knowledge Graph for Healthcare  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  

**Project Objective**  
Build a healthcare ontology linking diseases, symptoms, and treatments, and compare ontology-based inference with ML disease prediction.  

**Dataset Suggestions**  
[Disease Symptoms and Patient Profile Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itachi9604/disease-symptom-description-dataset)  

**Tasks**  
- **Ontology Creation**: Build classes for Disease, Symptom, Treatment.  
- **Data Integration**: Load symptom–disease relationships into the ontology.  
- **Ontology Reasoning**: Use SPARQL queries to infer possible diseases from symptom sets.  
- **ML Models (Classification)**:  
  - **Decision Tree** baseline.  
  - **Random Forest** for improved accuracy.  
  - **XGBoost** for handling complex symptom interactions.  
- **Evaluation**: Compare ontology vs ML predictions using accuracy and F1-score.  
- **Visualization**: Show knowledge graph with NetworkX.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Extend ontology with patient demographics (age, gender) for personalized predictions.  
- Add explainable AI (feature importance + ontology reasoning traces).

## Project 2: Ontology-Driven Research Paper Recommendation  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  

**Project Objective**  
Develop an ontology-driven recommendation system for research papers and compare it with ML-based recommender models.  

**Dataset Suggestions**  
[arXiv Academic Metadata Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv)  

**Tasks**  
- **Ontology Creation**: Build classes for Topics, Authors, Papers, Venues.  
- **Data Integration**: Import paper metadata (titles, abstracts, keywords).  
- **Ontology Queries**: Use SPARQL to retrieve papers by topic and keyword.  
- **ML Models (Recommendation)**:  
  - **TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity** for content-based recommendations.  
  - **K-Means Clustering** to group papers by abstract similarity.  
- **Evaluation**: Precision@k and Recall@k for both ontology and ML approaches.  
- **User Interface**: Simple CLI or Streamlit app for recommendations.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Compare recommendations across ontology-based vs ML-based pipelines.  
- Add author collaboration networks as extra ontology relations.

## Project 3: Ontology-Enhanced Anomaly Detection in Air Quality Data  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  

**Project Objective**  
Use an ontology to model environmental parameters (pollutants, thresholds) and detect anomalies, comparing ontology reasoning with ML anomaly detection methods.  

**Dataset Suggestions**  
[Air Quality Data Set (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+quality)  

**Tasks**  
- **Ontology Development**: Build ontology for Pollutants, Units, Safe Ranges.  
- **Data Loading**: Import historical air quality readings into ontology.  
- **Ontology Reasoning**: Flag anomalies when pollutant values exceed thresholds.  
- **ML Models (Anomaly Detection)**:  
  - **Isolation Forest** for high-dimensional anomaly detection.  
  - **One-Class SVM** for detecting unusual pollutant readings.  
- **Evaluation**: Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC (focus on recall for anomaly detection).  
- **Visualization**: Plot anomalies on time series with Seaborn/Matplotlib.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Extend to real-time anomaly detection using live air quality APIs.  
- Add semantic alerts (e.g., “High NO₂ in urban areas on weekdays”).
