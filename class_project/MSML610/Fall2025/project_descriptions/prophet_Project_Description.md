## Description  
Prophet is an open-source forecasting tool developed by Facebook (Meta), designed for producing high-quality forecasts for time series data. Its key features include:  

- Automatic handling of missing data and outliers.  
- Incorporation of daily, weekly, and yearly seasonal effects.  
- Ability to add holiday or special event effects.  
- Inclusion of external regressors to improve predictions.  
- Intuitive visualization of forecasts and trend components.

## Project 1: Sales Forecasting for a Retail Store  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  

**Project Objective**  
Forecast daily sales for a retail store to predict revenue trends for the next quarter.  

**Dataset Suggestions**  
[Store Sales â€“ Time Series Forecasting (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting)  

**Tasks**  
- **Data Preparation**: Format sales data for Prophet (`ds`, `y`). Handle missing values.  
- **Prophet Model**: Fit Prophet with weekly and yearly seasonality. Add holiday effects (e.g., Christmas, Black Friday).  
- **Forecasting**: Predict sales for the next 3 months.  
- **Model Comparisons**:  
  - **ARIMA** (baseline statistical model).  
  - **Random Forest Regressor** (tabular ML baseline).  
- **Evaluation**: Use RMSE and MAE to compare performance.  
- **Visualization**: Plot forecasts, seasonal decomposition, and holiday impacts.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Compare forecasts across different product categories.  
- Add promotion days as custom holidays in Prophet.

## Project 2: Energy Consumption Forecasting  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  

**Project Objective**  
Forecast daily household energy usage to support energy demand planning.  

**Dataset Suggestions**  
[Household Electric Power Consumption (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption)  

**Tasks**  
- **Data Cleaning**: Parse datetime, handle missing values, resample to daily averages.  
- **Prophet Model**: Fit Prophet with daily and weekly seasonality. Add temperature as an **external regressor**.  
- **Forecasting**: Generate energy consumption forecasts for the next 30 days.  
- **Model Comparisons**:  
  - **SARIMA** for time series with strong seasonal patterns.  
  - **XGBoost Regressor** for feature-driven forecasting.  
- **Evaluation**: Compare MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.  
- **Visualization**: Plot trend, seasonality, and regressor contributions.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Add holiday effects (weekends, public holidays) to improve Prophet forecasts.  
- Compare weekday vs weekend consumption patterns.

## Project 3: COVID-19 Case Prediction  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  

**Project Objective**  
Forecast future daily COVID-19 cases in a region to support healthcare planning.  

**Dataset Suggestions**  
[COVID-19 Dataset (Johns Hopkins University, Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report)  

**Tasks**  
- **Data Preparation**: Extract regional daily case counts, ensure correct date formatting.  
- **Prophet Model**: Fit Prophet with weekly seasonality (reporting cycles). Add interventions (lockdowns, vaccination start dates) as **custom holidays/external regressors**.  
- **Forecasting**: Predict daily cases for the next 4 weeks.  
- **Model Comparisons**:  
  - **ARIMA/SARIMA** for statistical baseline.  
  - **LSTM Neural Network (Keras)** for sequence modeling.  
- **Evaluation**: Use RMSE, MAE, and SMAPE.  
- **Visualization**: Plot actual vs predicted cases, confidence intervals, and intervention effects.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Scenario analysis: simulate stricter vs looser restrictions by adjusting holiday/regressor inputs.  
- Compare forecasts across multiple regions.
