**Description**

LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is a powerful tool for interpreting machine learning models by approximating them locally with interpretable models. It helps data scientists understand the predictions of complex models by providing insights into which features are influencing the output for individual predictions.

**Technologies Used**  
LIME  
- Provides interpretable explanations for any machine learning model.  
- Generates locally linear approximations of complex models.  
- Supports various data types, including tabular, text, and image data.

### Project 1: Diabetes Prediction with Model Interpretability  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  

**Project Objective**:  
Build a classification model to predict whether a person has diabetes based on health indicators and interpret the modelâ€™s predictions using LIME.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Kaggle: [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, scale features, and split into training/testing sets.  
- **Model Training**: Train a Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifier using `scikit-learn`.  
- **LIME Explanations**: Use the `lime` package to explain individual patient predictions.  
- **Visualization**: Generate plots showing which health features (e.g., BMI, glucose level) most influence predictions.

### Project 2: Employee Attrition Prediction  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  

**Project Objective**:  
Develop a model to predict employee attrition in organizations and utilize LIME to provide insights into why employees are likely to leave.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Kaggle: [Employee Attrition and Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Exploration**: Perform EDA to understand attrition trends and correlations.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features from employee demographics and work conditions.  
- **Model Development**: Train Gradient Boosting (e.g., `xgboost` or `lightgbm`) to predict attrition.  
- **LIME Explanations**: Use LIME to interpret model predictions, highlighting which factors (e.g., overtime, job role) drive attrition.  
- **Reporting**: Summarize insights into actionable recommendations for HR teams.

### Project 3: Food Image Classification with LIME Explanations  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  

**Project Objective**:  
Build an image classification model to identify types of food and use LIME to interpret CNN predictions by showing which image regions influenced the classification.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- Kaggle: [Food-101 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/food41) (101 categories of food images).  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Preparation**: Preprocess and normalize images; apply data augmentation.  
- **Model Construction**: Train a Convolutional Neural Network using `TensorFlow/Keras` or `PyTorch`.  
- **LIME Integration**: Apply LIME to generate explanations for selected test images, showing highlighted regions.  
- **Evaluation**: Assess accuracy and interpretability of the CNN model.  
- **Advanced Analysis**: Experiment with deeper architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) and compare interpretability outputs.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional):**  
- For Project 1, compare LIME explanations with `SHAP` for robustness.  
- For Project 2, test different feature subsets and evaluate how explanations change.  
- For Project 3, fine-tune a pre-trained CNN (transfer learning) and evaluate whether explanations differ compared to a scratch-trained model.
