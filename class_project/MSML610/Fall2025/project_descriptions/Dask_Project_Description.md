**Description**

Dask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytics that enables users to scale their computations across multiple cores or clusters. It integrates seamlessly with NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, making it ideal for handling large datasets and complex computations efficiently.  

Technologies Used  
Dask  

- Enables parallel computing with minimal changes to existing NumPy and Pandas code.  
- Supports out-of-core computation, allowing the processing of datasets larger than memory.  
- Provides advanced scheduling capabilities for distributed computing.

### Project 1: News Article Recommendation System  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy) 

**Project Objective**  
Build a recommendation system that suggests news articles to readers based on collaborative filtering techniques. The goal is to optimize recommendations using large-scale user interaction data.  

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- [MIND: Microsoft News Recommendation Dataset](https://msnews.github.io/) (contains millions of user click histories and news articles).  

**Tasks**  
- **Load Data with Dask**: Read the large MIND dataset into a Dask DataFrame for scalable preprocessing.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean interaction logs, normalize article metadata.  
- **Build User-Item Matrix**: Construct a sparse matrix of user-article interactions.  
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Implement user- or item-based collaborative filtering with Dask-ML.  
- **Generate Recommendations**: Recommend top-N articles for each user.  
- **Evaluation**: Use metrics like RMSE, MAP@K, or NDCG to evaluate recommendation quality.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Compare collaborative filtering with a baseline popularity-based recommender.  
- Explore hybrid recommendations by incorporating article content (text embeddings).

### Project 2: Large-Scale Airline Passenger Sentiment Analysis  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium) 

**Project Objective**  
Perform sentiment analysis on airline passenger tweets to evaluate service quality and trends. The goal is to analyze large-scale feedback and visualize sentiment distributions over time.  

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- [Twitter US Airline Sentiment Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment) (contains ~15K labeled tweets with positive, negative, neutral sentiments).  

**Tasks**  
- **Load with Dask**: Load and explore the dataset at scale.  
- **Preprocessing**: Clean tweets (remove hashtags, links, mentions), tokenize text.  
- **Sentiment Classification**: Use pretrained sentiment analyzers (e.g., VADER, TextBlob) or train simple classifiers with Dask-ML.  
- **Trend Analysis**: Aggregate sentiments over time or by airline.  
- **Visualization**: Plot time-series sentiment trends and distribution per airline.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Compare rule-based models (VADER) vs ML classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).  
- Extend analysis to aspect-based sentiment (e.g., delays vs staff service).

### Project 3: Energy Consumption Forecasting for Smart Grids  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  

**Project Objective**  
Develop a predictive model to forecast household energy consumption using large-scale smart meter data, enabling better demand management and reducing costs.  

**Dataset Suggestions**  
- [UK Domestic Electricity Smart Meter Dataset](https://data.ukdataservice.ac.uk/series/2000056) (Smart Energy Research Lab - anonymized household energy usage, time-series).  
- Alternative: [UCI Electricity Load Diagrams Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014).  

**Tasks**  
- **Load with Dask**: Use Dask to handle the large time-series dataset efficiently.  
- **EDA**: Explore consumption patterns across households and time periods.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Create lag features, rolling averages, seasonal indicators (holidays, weekdays).  
- **Model Development**: Train scalable ML models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Random Forest with Dask-ML) to forecast consumption.  
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate models using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.  
- **Visualization**: Plot actual vs predicted consumption curves.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Experiment with ensemble methods or sequence models (e.g., RNNs with chunked training).  
- Build a dashboard with Dask + Bokeh/Streamlit for interactive visualization.
