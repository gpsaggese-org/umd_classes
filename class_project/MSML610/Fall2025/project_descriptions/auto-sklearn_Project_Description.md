## Description  
Auto-sklearn is an automated machine learning (AutoML) tool built on top of the popular scikit-learn library. It automatically selects models, hyperparameters, and data pre-processing methods to optimize the model's performance on a given dataset. Key features include:  

- Selection of the best model pipelines using Bayesian optimization.  
- Automatic feature preprocessing and engineering.  
- Built-in ensemble construction for improved predictive accuracy.  
- Handles both classification and regression tasks efficiently.

### Project 2: House Price Estimation in India  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  

**Project Objective**:  
Estimate house prices across India using structured tabular data that includes features such as location, size, and number of rooms. The goal is to apply auto-sklearn to build optimized regression models for accurate price prediction.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: India House Price Prediction
- **Link**: [India House Price Prediction (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankushpanday1/india-house-price-prediction)  

**Tasks**:  
- Preprocess the dataset: handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize features.  
- Use auto-sklearn to automatically generate and optimize regression models.  
- Compare auto-sklearn’s best ensemble with baseline models (Random Forest, XGBoost).  
- Evaluate predictions using MAE and RMSE.  
- Visualize regional house price variations and prediction errors across states.

**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  

**Project Objective**:  
Detect unusual traffic conditions and anomalies in traffic flow using structured time series data, optimized with auto-sklearn.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Dataset  
- **Link**: [Metro Traffic Volume (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ramyahr/metro-interstate-traffic-volume)  

**Tasks**:  
- Load and preprocess traffic data (time, weather, holiday information).  
- Use auto-sklearn to train anomaly detection and classification models.  
- Evaluate detection accuracy using precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Compare auto-sklearn’s optimized ensembles with traditional anomaly detection methods (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM).
