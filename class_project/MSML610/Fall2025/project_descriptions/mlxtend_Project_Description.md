## Description

MLxtend (Machine Learning Extensions) is a Python library designed to extend the capabilities of popular machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn. It provides additional functionalities such as data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, making it easier for data scientists to build and optimize machine learning models. Key features include:

- **Feature Selection**: Offers methods for selecting the most relevant features to improve model performance.  
- **Ensemble Methods**: Implements various ensemble techniques to boost the accuracy of predictions.  
- **Visualization Tools**: Provides functions for visualizing model performance and relationships between features.  
- **Stacking**: Allows for stacking multiple models to improve predictive accuracy.

## Project 1: Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  

**Project Objective**: Segment customers based on their purchasing behavior to identify distinct groups for targeted marketing strategies.  

**Dataset Suggestions**: [Online Retail II (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mashlyn/online-retail-ii-uci)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and normalize numerical features.  
- **Feature Selection**: Use MLxtend’s `SequentialFeatureSelector` to identify the most relevant features for clustering.  
- **K-means Clustering**: Apply K-means clustering to group customers.  
- **Visualization**: Use MLxtend’s cluster visualization tools to interpret cluster separation.  
- **Analysis**: Characterize each segment (e.g., high spenders, frequent shoppers).  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: Compare with Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN, and use MLxtend’s silhouette plots for evaluation.

## Project 2: Predicting Housing Prices with Ensemble Learning  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  

**Project Objective**: Predict housing prices using ensemble learning techniques to improve predictive accuracy.  

**Dataset Suggestions**: [New York City Property Sales (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/new-york-city/nyc-property-sales)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle categorical variables with one-hot encoding and impute missing values.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Create features like price per square foot and neighborhood-level aggregations.  
- **Model Building**:  
  - Use **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** as baselines.  
  - Implement **StackingClassifier/StackingRegressor** from MLxtend to combine multiple models.  
- **Evaluation**: Use cross-validation and MLxtend’s learning curve/validation curve functions.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: Apply grid search for hyperparameter optimization and compare stacking with bagging and boosting approaches.

## Project 3: Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic Data  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  

**Project Objective**: Detect anomalies in network traffic data that could indicate potential cyberattacks.  

**Dataset Suggestions**: [UNSW-NB15 Network Intrusion Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrwellsdavid/unsw-nb15)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Parse categorical network features (protocol, service) and scale numerical attributes.  
- **Feature Selection**: Apply MLxtend’s feature selection (e.g., `ExhaustiveFeatureSelector`) to reduce dimensionality.  
- **Model Implementation**:  
  - Train **Isolation Forest** and **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)** for anomaly detection.  
  - Compare with supervised classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost) if labels are available.  
- **Evaluation**: Use MLxtend’s ROC and precision-recall plots to evaluate detection accuracy on imbalanced data.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: Experiment with semi-supervised anomaly detection, and visualize feature importances to identify which traffic attributes contribute most to anomalies.
