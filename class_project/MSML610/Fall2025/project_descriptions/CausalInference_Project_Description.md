## Description  
CausalInference is a Python library designed for estimating causal effects and understanding the relationships between variables in observational data. It provides a range of methods for causal inference, including propensity score matching, instrumental variables, and regression discontinuity designs. The tool is particularly useful for researchers and data scientists looking to derive insights from data where randomized control trials are not feasible.  

**Features of CausalInference:**  
- Offers methods for estimating causal effects from observational data.  
- Supports various techniques such as propensity score matching and regression discontinuity.  
- Facilitates model validation and robustness checks to ensure reliable results.

## Project 1: Understanding the Impact of Education on Income Levels  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  

**Project Objective**:  
Estimate the causal effect of education level on income by analyzing the relationship between educational attainment and average annual income in a given population.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: "Adult Income Dataset" on Kaggle  
- **Link**: [Adult Income Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset, ensuring that variables (education level, income, demographics) are correctly formatted.  
- **Define Treatment and Outcome**: Treatment = education level; Outcome = income.  
- **Propensity Score Matching**: Implement PSM to create a balanced dataset for comparison.  
- **Estimate Causal Effect**: Use CausalInference to estimate the causal effect of education on income.  
- **Interpret Results**: Analyze estimates, including confidence intervals, to conclude the impact of education.  

**Bonus Idea (Optional)**: Add demographic interactions (e.g., gender Ã— education) to see if causal effects vary across subgroups.

## Project 2: Evaluating the Effect of Public Health Interventions on Disease Spread  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  

**Project Objective**:  
Assess the causal impact of a vaccination campaign on the spread of COVID-19, accounting for confounders such as demographics and healthcare access.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: "COVID-19 Vaccination Data" from Our World in Data  
- **Link**: [COVID-19 Vaccinations](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Acquisition**: Gather vaccination rates and case incidence over time.  
- **Identify Confounders**: Include potential confounders (population density, age distribution, healthcare capacity).  
- **Instrumental Variables**: Use IV techniques to estimate causal effect of vaccination on case counts while addressing confounding.  
- **Model Validation**: Perform robustness checks, including placebo tests, to validate estimates.  
- **Policy Recommendations**: Provide evidence-based recommendations for improving vaccination campaigns.  

**Bonus Idea (Optional)**: Extend the analysis by comparing causal effects across countries with different healthcare systems.

## Project 3: Analyzing the Impact of Remote Work on Employee Productivity  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  

**Project Objective**:  
Investigate the causal relationship between remote work policies and employee productivity metrics, identifying how productivity varies across roles and demographics.  

**Dataset Suggestions**:  
- **Dataset**: "Employee Productivity Dataset" on Kaggle  
- **Link**: [Employee Productivity Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset, focusing on features related to productivity and work arrangements (simulate remote vs office groups if needed).  
- **Define Treatment Groups**: Treatment = remote work; Control = in-office work.  
- **Regression Discontinuity Design**: Apply RDD with a cutoff variable (e.g., company policy change date or productivity threshold).  
- **Explore Heterogeneous Effects**: Estimate how effects vary by job role, age, or department.  
- **Reporting and Visualization**: Present findings through causal plots, reports, and recommendations for management.  

**Bonus Idea (Optional)**: Extend analysis to include employee satisfaction or retention as additional outcomes.
