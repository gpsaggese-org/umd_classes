**Description**

pmdarima is a powerful Python library designed for automatic ARIMA modeling, making it easier to build time-series forecasting models. It simplifies the process of identifying the optimal parameters for ARIMA models while providing functionality to validate and evaluate model performance effectively. 

Features:
- Automated parameter selection using the `auto_arima` function.
- Support for seasonal and non-seasonal ARIMA models.
- Built-in diagnostics for model evaluation and residual analysis.
- Capability to handle missing values and outliers seamlessly.

### Project 1: Time Series Forecasting of Monthly Airline Passengers
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)

**Project Objective**: 
Predict the number of airline passengers for the next 12 months based on historical monthly passenger data. The goal is to optimize the forecasting accuracy using ARIMA modeling.

**Dataset Suggestions**:
- Use the "Airline Passenger Satisfaction" dataset available on Kaggle: [Airline Passenger Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhendra/airline-passenger-satisfaction).

**Tasks**:
- Load and Preprocess Data:
    - Import the dataset and clean any missing values or anomalies.
- Visualize Time Series:
    - Plot the historical data to identify trends and seasonality.
- Model Selection:
    - Use `pmdarima.auto_arima` to determine the best ARIMA parameters.
- Forecasting:
    - Generate forecasts for the next 12 months and evaluate the model's performance using metrics like MAE and RMSE.
- Visualization of Results:
    - Create plots comparing historical data with the forecasted values.

### Project 2: Stock Price Prediction Using ARIMA
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)

**Project Objective**: 
Build a forecasting model to predict the daily closing prices of a specific stock (e.g., Apple Inc.) over the next month. The goal is to optimize the model for accuracy and robustness.

**Dataset Suggestions**:
- Use the "Apple Stock Price" dataset available on Yahoo Finance via the `yfinance` library or directly from Kaggle: [Apple Stock Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/srajanp/apple-stock-price).

**Tasks**:
- Data Acquisition:
    - Fetch historical stock price data using the `yfinance` library.
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Handle missing values and create a time series index.
- Exploratory Data Analysis:
    - Visualize price trends, moving averages, and other relevant indicators.
- Model Training:
    - Apply `pmdarima.auto_arima` to find optimal ARIMA parameters for daily closing prices.
- Performance Evaluation:
    - Split the data into training and testing sets, evaluate the model using AIC/BIC, and visualize forecasts against actual prices.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Compare ARIMA model performance with other models like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing.
- Implement rolling forecasts to assess how the model performs over time.

### Project 3: Energy Consumption Forecasting for Smart Grids
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)

**Project Objective**: 
Develop a forecasting model to predict hourly energy consumption for a smart grid system over the next week. The objective is to optimize the model for accuracy while handling large-scale and noisy data.

**Dataset Suggestions**:
- Use the "Individual household electric power consumption" dataset available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Electric Power Consumption Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption).

**Tasks**:
- Data Preparation:
    - Load the dataset, parse dates, and handle missing values.
- Time Series Decomposition:
    - Decompose the time series to analyze trend, seasonality, and residuals.
- Model Development:
    - Use `pmdarima.auto_arima` to find the best ARIMA model parameters for hourly energy consumption.
- Model Validation:
    - Implement cross-validation techniques to assess model stability and performance over different time periods.
- Forecasting and Analysis:
    - Generate forecasts for the next week and visualize the results, including confidence intervals.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:
- Explore the impact of external factors (e.g., weather data) on energy consumption forecasts.
- Implement a hybrid model combining ARIMA with machine learning techniques for improved accuracy.
