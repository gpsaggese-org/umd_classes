## Description

Blitz is a powerful Python library designed for rapid prototyping and experimentation in machine learning. It provides a high-level interface for building and training models quickly while maintaining flexibility and control over the underlying architecture. Blitz is particularly useful for tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering, and it supports integration with popular libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.

## Project 1: Customer Segmentation for E-commerce  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective**: Segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using clustering techniques to optimize marketing strategies.  

**Dataset Suggestions**: [Online Retail Dataset II (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mashlyn/online-retail-ii-uci)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Loading**: Import the dataset into Pandas.  
- **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, remove cancellations/returns, and normalize features.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Construct RFM features (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value).  
- **Clustering**:  
  - Use Blitz to rapidly prototype **K-Means** clustering.  
  - Compare with **Agglomerative Clustering** and **DBSCAN**.  
- **Visualization**: Plot customer clusters to identify distinct groups.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: Perform silhouette score evaluation for different models, and visualize cluster stability across different parameters.

## Project 2: Energy Consumption Forecasting  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective**: Predict household energy consumption to support energy efficiency and demand forecasting.  

**Dataset Suggestions**: [Household Electric Power Consumption Dataset (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Data Cleaning**: Parse datetime features and handle missing readings.  
- **EDA**: Visualize time series trends, daily/weekly cycles, and anomalies.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Create lag features, rolling averages, and time-based encodings (hour, weekday).  
- **Model Training (via Blitz)**:  
  - **Linear Regression** as a baseline.  
  - **Random Forest Regressor** for non-linear relationships.  
  - **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)** for improved forecasting accuracy.  
- **Evaluation**: Measure RMSE and MAE, and visualize predicted vs. actual energy usage.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: Use Blitz with **LSTM/GRU** for sequential forecasting and compare against tree-based regressors.

## Project 3: Sentiment Analysis on Climate Change Tweets  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective**: Build a sentiment classification pipeline to analyze public opinion on climate change.  

**Dataset Suggestions**: [Climate Change Tweets Sentiment Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edqian/twitter-climate-change-sentiment-dataset)  

**Tasks**:  
- **Preprocessing**: Clean tweet text (remove hashtags, mentions, URLs, emojis).  
- **Feature Extraction**:  
  - Use **TF-IDF** features.  
  - Experiment with **pretrained GloVe embeddings** for semantic understanding.  
- **Model Training (via Blitz)**:  
  - **Logistic Regression** as a baseline.  
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for stronger separation.  
  - **LightGBM Classifier** for efficiency on sparse data.  
  - Optional: fine-tune a **DistilBERT (HuggingFace)** model for deep NLP.  
- **Evaluation**: Compare models using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.  
- **Visualization**: Plot sentiment distribution and generate word clouds for positive vs. negative tweets.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**:  
- Apply **topic modeling (LDA)** to identify key subthemes in climate discussions.  
- Track sentiment shifts over time and relate them to climate-related news events.
