**Description**

Tianshou is a high-performance reinforcement learning library designed for Python, enabling the development and training of various RL algorithms with ease. It offers a flexible and modular framework for building agents, facilitating experimentation and optimization in reinforcement learning tasks.

Technologies Used
Tianshou

- Provides a rich set of built-in reinforcement learning algorithms (DQN, PPO, A2C, etc.).
- Supports multi-agent environments, allowing for complex interactions and learning scenarios.
- Offers tools for easy integration with OpenAI Gym and other environments for training and evaluation.
- Facilitates logging and visualization of training processes and performance metrics.

**Project 1: Basic Game Agent Development**  
**Difficulty:** 1 (Easy)  
**Project Objective:** Develop a reinforcement learning agent using Tianshou that learns to play a simple game (e.g., CartPole) and optimizes its performance over time.

**Dataset Suggestions:**  
- Use OpenAI Gym environments (specifically, the CartPole-v1 environment) which are readily available and free to use.

**Tasks:**
- Set Up Tianshou Environment:
  - Install Tianshou and set up the CartPole environment from OpenAI Gym.
- Create the Agent:
  - Implement a DQN agent using Tianshou's built-in classes and methods.
- Training:
  - Train the agent over a specified number of episodes, adjusting hyperparameters as needed.
- Evaluation:
  - Evaluate the agent's performance by measuring the average reward over multiple episodes.
- Visualization:
  - Plot the training rewards over time to visualize learning progress.

**Project 2: Multi-Agent Collaboration in a Grid World**  
**Difficulty:** 2 (Medium)  
**Project Objective:** Design and implement a multi-agent reinforcement learning system using Tianshou where agents learn to cooperate to achieve a common goal in a grid world environment.

**Dataset Suggestions:**  
- Create a custom grid world environment using OpenAI Gym, or use existing environments like "Multi-Agent Particle Environment" available on GitHub.

**Tasks:**
- Environment Setup:
  - Define a grid world environment with obstacles and goals for agents to navigate.
- Multi-Agent Implementation:
  - Use Tianshou to implement multiple agents and define their interaction rules.
- Training Strategy:
  - Train agents using a shared reward system to encourage collaboration.
- Performance Metrics:
  - Measure and analyze the collective performance of agents based on successful goal achievement.
- Visualization:
  - Create visualizations to illustrate agent movements and interactions in the grid world.

**Project 3: Stock Trading Agent Optimization**  
**Difficulty:** 3 (Hard)  
**Project Objective:** Build a reinforcement learning agent using Tianshou that learns to trade stocks in a simulated environment, optimizing for maximum return on investment.

**Dataset Suggestions:**  
- Use historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance (e.g., daily prices for AAPL or TSLA) available through the yfinance library.

**Tasks:**
- Environment Design:
  - Create a custom trading environment based on OpenAI Gym that simulates stock trading with buy/sell actions.
- Agent Development:
  - Implement a PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) agent using Tianshou to handle the complexities of trading decisions.
- Training and Fine-Tuning:
  - Train the agent using historical stock data and fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- Evaluation:
  - Evaluate the agent's trading performance based on metrics like Sharpe ratio, total return, and drawdown.
- Visualization:
  - Visualize the agent's trading strategy alongside stock price movements to analyze decision-making.

**Bonus Ideas (Optional):**
- For Project 1, experiment with different algorithms (like PPO or A2C) to compare performance.
- For Project 2, introduce competitive elements where agents can hinder each other's progress and observe the effects.
- For Project 3, incorporate transaction costs and slippage to simulate more realistic trading conditions.
