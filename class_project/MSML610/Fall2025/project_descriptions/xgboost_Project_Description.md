## Description

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful and efficient implementation of gradient boosting frameworks designed for speed and performance. It is particularly known for its ability to handle sparse data and its capability to optimize large datasets effectively. XGBoost provides features such as:

- Parallelized tree boosting for faster training.  
- Regularization to prevent overfitting.  
- Support for missing values and various objective functions.  
- Built-in cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning capabilities.

## Project 1: Predicting Airbnb Rental Prices  
**Difficulty**: 1 (Easy)  

**Project Objective**  
Predict nightly rental prices of Airbnb listings based on property characteristics, location, and host attributes using XGBoost regression.  

**Dataset Suggestions**  
[New York City Airbnb Open Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)  

**Tasks**  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, drop irrelevant columns, and filter extreme outliers in price.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Derive features like price per guest, room density, and neighborhood popularity.  
- **Model Training**: Train an XGBoost regression model on the processed dataset.  
- **Evaluation**: Use RMSE and R² metrics to evaluate accuracy.  
- **Visualization**: Compare predicted vs actual rental prices, and plot feature importance.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Compare performance with Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor.  
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using XGBoost’s `cv()` function.

## Project 2: Employee Attrition Prediction  
**Difficulty**: 2 (Medium)  

**Project Objective**  
Predict whether employees are likely to leave a company using demographic, job satisfaction, and performance data.  

**Dataset Suggestions**  
[IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)  

**Tasks**  
- **EDA**: Explore attrition patterns by age, role, and work-life balance.  
- **Preprocessing**: Encode categorical features and scale numeric attributes.  
- **Model Training**: Train an XGBoost classifier to predict attrition.  
- **Evaluation**: Measure accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
- **Feature Importance**: Use XGBoost’s feature importance and SHAP values for interpretability.  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Compare XGBoost with Logistic Regression and Random Forest.  
- Implement class weighting to handle imbalance in attrition cases.

## Project 3: Airline Delay Prediction  
**Difficulty**: 3 (Hard)  

**Project Objective**  
Develop a classification model that predicts whether a flight will be delayed based on historical flight and weather data using XGBoost.  

**Dataset Suggestions**  
[US Airline On-Time Performance Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays)  

**Tasks**  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Merge flight schedule data with weather information, handle missing values.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Create features like departure time, day of week, airline, origin/destination airports, and weather conditions.  
- **Model Training**: Train an XGBoost classifier to predict flight delays (on-time vs delayed).  
- **Evaluation**: Use precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC due to class imbalance.  
- **Visualization**: Plot feature importance (e.g., weather vs airline vs airport factors).  

**Bonus Ideas (Optional)**  
- Compare XGBoost with LightGBM and CatBoost.  
- Build a delay prediction dashboard with interactive plots.
