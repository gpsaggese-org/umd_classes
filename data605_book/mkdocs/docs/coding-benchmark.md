AbanteAi Mentatbot

- [https://mentat.ai/docs/setup](https://mentat.ai/docs/setup)  
- A bot, one can attach to a repo and get him to execute reviews/PRs etc.  
- It seems to be very early and there is quite a lot of bugs at the moment  
  - It’s not working correctly  
  - They are responsive on discord but seems like it’s far from refined

- Should we possibly implement a lightweight bot? It should be pretty simple as far the GH integration goes  
  - On the other hand, GH copilot is promising something similar “soon”
