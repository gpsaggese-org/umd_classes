TL;DR: `mdm` unifies management of research ideas, blog posts, and Claude Code
skills across multiple repositories into one powerful command-line tool.

## The Problem: Scattered Content
- Different types of markdown content live in separate directories
  - Blog posts in one location
  - Claude Code skills in another
  - Research ideas in a third
- Each content type requires knowing:
  - Its directory location
  - Its specific command prefix
  - Its unique workflow
- Searching across content types means context switching and remembering
  multiple commands
- `mdm` solves this by unifying everything into a single interface

## What Is Mdm?
- A unified markdown file manager that consolidates four separate bash script
  families into one tool
  - Replaces `skill*`, `blog*`, `res*`, and `story*` command families
  - Provides consistent interface for all content types
  - Supports prefix matching to reduce typing
- Enables you to manage all markdown content from anywhere
  - No need to navigate to specific directories
  - One command for all operations

## Content Types Managed
- `mdm` organizes content into four types, each stored separately:
  - **research**: Research ideas in `<umd_classes1>/research/ideas/`
  - **blog**: Blog posts in `<blog_repo>/blog/posts/`
  - **story**: Short stories in `<notes1>/short_stories/`
  - **skill**: Claude Code skills in `<helpers_root>/.claude/skills/`
- Each type maintains its own directory structure and conventions

## Core Actions
- **list**: List markdown files with optional filtering
  - Shows skill names only for skills (e.g., `blog.add_figures`)
  - Shows full file paths for other content types
  - Supports optional name filters to narrow results
- **full_list**: Display all markdown files with complete paths
  - Useful for seeing directory structure
  - Supports optional name filtering
- **describe**: Show descriptions of markdown files
  - Primarily works with skills containing metadata
- **edit**: Open file in vim with automatic template generation
  - Creates new files with appropriate templates if they don't exist
  - Blog posts get YAML frontmatter with title, author, date, and TL;DR
  - Skills get summary section headers
  - Research items get headers with idea names
- **directory**: Print the directory path for given type
  - Useful for scripting and automation
- **types**: Print unique prefixes before first dot

## Smart Prefix Matching
- Both type and action arguments support prefix matching where first match wins
- Type prefixes:
  - `sk` -> `skill`
  - `bl` -> `blog`
  - `res` -> `research`
  - `st` -> `story`
- Action prefixes:
  - `l` -> `list`
  - `f` -> `full_list`
  - `d` -> `describe` or `directory` (first match)
  - `e` -> `edit`
  - `t` -> `types`
- Allows shortcuts like `mdm bl l` instead of `mdm blog list`

## Practical Usage Examples
- List all skills to inventory what you have available:
  - `mdm skill list` shows skill names only
- See full paths for all skills:
  - `mdm skill full_list` includes directory paths
- Filter research items by pattern:
  - `mdm research list causal` finds items containing "causal"
- Create or edit a new blog post:
  - `mdm blog edit My_New_Post` opens vim with template
- Get the directory path for a content type:
  - `mdm research directory` prints path to research folder
- See unique content types in skills:
  - `mdm skill types` shows unique prefixes
