* Data Models
- **Data modeling**
  - Represents and captures structure and properties of real-world entities
  - Abstraction: real-world $\to$ **representation**

- **Data model**
  - Describes how data is _represented_ (e.g., relational, key-value) and _accessed_ (e.g., insert operations, query)
  - Schema in a DB describes a specific data collection using a data model

- **Why need data model?**
  - Know data structure to write general-purpose code
  - Share data across programs, organizations, systems
  - Integrate information from multiple sources
  - Preprocess data for efficient access (e.g., building an index)

* Multiple Layers of Data Modeling
::: columns
:::: {.column width=50%}

- **Physical layer**
  - How is the data physically stored
  - How to represent complex data structures (e.g., B-trees for indexing)
- **Logical layer**
  - Entities
  - Attributes
  - Type of information stored
  - Relationships among the above
- **Views**
  - Restrict information flow
  - Security and/or ease-of-use

* Data Models: Logical Layer

::: columns
:::: {.column width=50%}

- **Modeling constructs**
  - Concepts to represent data structure
  - E.g.,
    - Entity types
    - Entity attributes
    - Relationships between entities
    - Relationships between attributes
- **Integrity constraints**
  - Ensure data integrity
    - Avoid errors and inconsistencies
    - E.g., field can't be empty, must be an integer
- **Manipulation constructs**
  - E.g., insert, update, delete data

* Examples of Data Models
- We will cover:
  - Relational model (SQL)
  - Entity-relationship (ER) model
  - XML
  - Object-oriented (OO)
  - Object-relational
  - RDF
  - Property graph
- Serialization formats as data models
  - CSV
  - Parquet
  - JSON
  - Protocol Buffer
  - Avro/Thrift
  - Python Pickle

* Good Data Models
- Data model should be:
  - Expressive
    - Capture real-world data
  - Easy to use
  - Perform well
- Tension between characteristics
  - Powerful models
    - Represent more datasets
    - Harder to use/query
    - Less efficient (e.g., more memory, time)
- Evolution of data modeling tools captures data structure
  - Structured data $\to$ Relational DBs
  - Semi-structured web data $\to$ XML, JSON
  - Unstructured data $\to$ NoSQL DBs

* Data Independence
- **Logical data independence**
  - Change data representation without altering programs
  - E.g., API abstracting backend


- **Physical data independence**
  - Change data layout on disk without altering programs
    - Index data
    - Partition/distribute/replicate data
    - Compress data
    - Sort data

* Databases: A Brief History
- **1960s: Early beginning**
  - Computers become attractive technology
  - Enterprises adopt computers
  - Applications use own data stores
    - Each application has its own format
    - Data unavailable to other programs
  - **Database**: term for "shared data banks" by multiple applications
    - Define data format
    - Store as "data dictionary" (schema)
    - Implement "database management" software to access data
  - Issues:
    - How to write data dictionaries?
    - How to access data?
    - Who controls the data?
    - E.g., integrity, security, privacy concerns

* Databases: A Brief History
- **1960s, Hierarchical and Network Model**
  - Connect records of different types
  - Example: connect accounts with customers
  - Network model aimed for generality and flexibility
- IBM's IMS Hierarchical Database (1966)
  - Designed for Apollo space program
  - Predates hard disks
  - Used by over 95% of top Fortune 1000 companies
  - Processes 50 billion transactions daily, manages 15 million gigabytes of data
- Cons:
  - Exposed too much internal data (structures/pointers)
  - Leaky abstraction

* Relational, Hierarchical, Network Model

::: columns
:::: {.column width=50%}
- **Relational model**
  - Data as tuples in relations
  - SQL
- **Hierarchical model**
  - Tree-like structure
    - One parent, many children
    - Connected through links
  - XML DBs resurgence in 1990s
- **Network model**
  - Graph organization
    - Multiple parents and children
  - Graph DBs resurgence in 2010s

* Databases: A Brief History
- **1970s: Relational model**
  - Set theory, first-order predicate logic
    - Ted Codd developed the Relational Model
  - Elegant, formal model
    - Provided data independence
    - Users didn't worry about data storage, processing
  - High-level query language
    - SQL based on relational algebra
  - Notion of normal forms
    - Reason about data and relations
    - Remove redundancies
- Influential projects:
  - INGRES (UC Berkeley), System R (IBM)
  - Ignored IMS compatibility
- Debates: Relational Model vs Network Model proponents

* Entity-Relationship Model

::: columns
:::: {.column width=50%}

- 1976: Peter Chen proposed "Entity-Relationship Model"
- Describes knowledge as entities and relationships
- **Entities**: Physical or logical objects, "Nouns"
- **Relationships**: Connections between entities, "Verbs"
- Map ER model to relational DB: Entities, relationships $\to$ tables

* Databases: A Brief History
- **1980s: Relational model acceptance**
  - SQL standard due to IBM's backing
  - Enhanced relational model
    - Set-valued attributes, aggregation
- Late 80's
  - Object-oriented DBs
    - Store objects, not tables
    - Overcome _impedance mismatch_ between languages and databases
  - Object-relational DBs
    - User-defined types
    - Combine object-oriented benefits with relational model
  - No expressive difference from pure relational model

* Object-Oriented
- OOP is a data model
  - Object behavior described through data (fields) and code (methods)

- **Composition**
  - Aka `has-a` relationships
  - E.g., `Employee` class has an `Address` class
- **Inheritance**
  - Aka `is-a` relationships
  - E.g., `Employee` class derives from `Person` class

- **Polymorphism**
  - Code executed depends on the class of the object
  - One interface, many implementations
  - E.g., `draw()` method on a `Circle` vs `Square` object, both descending from
    `Shape` class

- **Encapsulation**
  - E.g., private vs public fields/members
  - Prevents external code from accessing inner workings of an object

* Databases: A Brief History
- **Late 90's-today**
- Web/Internet emerges
- XML: eXtensible Markup Language
  - For _semi-structured_ data
  - Tree-like structure
  - Flexible schema
