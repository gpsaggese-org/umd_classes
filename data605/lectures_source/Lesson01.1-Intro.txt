* Tools We Will Learn To Use
- **Programming languages**
  - Python

- **Development tools**
  - Bash/Linux OS
  - Git: data model, branching
  - GitHub: Pull Requests (PR), issues
  - Jupyter notebooks
  - Docker

- **Big data tools**
  - Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipelines
  - Relational DBs (PostgreSQL)
  - NoSQL DBs (HBase, MongoDB, Couchbase, Redis)
  - Graph DBs (Neo4j, GraphX, Giraph)
  - Computing framework (Hadoop, Spark, Dask)
  - Workflow manager (Airflow)
  - Cloud services (AWS)

- **Tutorials** for tools used in the class projects

* Todos
- Study slides and materials
- DATA605 - ELMS/Canvas site
  - Enable notifications
  - Contact info for me/TAs
- Check DATA605 Schedule
- Check DATA605 GitHub repo
- Check DATA605 FAQs
- Setup computing environment
  - Install Linux/VMware
  - Install Docker on laptop

- Bring laptop to class
- Lessons recorded
  - Still attend class, when possible

* Grading
- **Quizzes**
  - 40% of grade
  - Multi-choice on previous 2 lessons
  - 20 questions in 20 minutes
  - 4-5 quizzes to encourage study during semester

- **Final Project**
  - 60% of grade
  - Comprehensive application of course concepts
  - Big data project in Python from a list of topics
  - Individual or group

* Class Projects
- The project is _"Build $X$ with $Y$"_, where $X$ is a "use case" and $Y$ is a
  "technology"
  - Study and describe technology $Y$
  - Implement use case $X$ using technology $Y$
  - Create Jupyter notebooks to demo your project
  - Commit code to GitHub, contribute to open-source repo
  - Write a blog entry
  - Present your project in a video

- Choose from list of $X$ and $Y$, e.g.,
  - Big data
  - Large language models
  - ...

- Each project:
  - Individual or group ($n < 4$)
  - Varying difficulty levels

* Soft Skills to Succeed in the Workplace
- **Goal**: model class project for workplace preparation
  - Work in a team
  - Design software architecture (OOP, Agile, Design Patterns)
  - Comment your code
  - Write external documentation (tutorials, manuals, how-tos)
  - Write understandable code (including for future-you)
  - Read others' code
  - Follow code conventions (PEP8, Google Code)
  - Communicate clearly (emails, Slack)
  - File a bug report
  - Reproduce a bug
  - Intuition of CS constants
  - Basic understanding of OS (virtual memory, processes)

* Yours Truly
