# Books of the Class
# ##############################################################################

- Because AI and machine learning are improving so quickly there is not a single
  book that we can use in this class to cover the material
- The slides used in this class are derived from a variety of sources including
  books, technical articles, and the Internet
  - This means that they are designed to be comprehensive and provide all the
    necessary information you need to understand the topics being discussed
- The goal is for the slides to be self-sufficient, meaning you should be able to
  grasp the key concepts and ideas without needing to refer back to the original
  sources
- This approach ensures that you have a clear and concise understanding of the
  material, which is crucial for learning complex subjects like machine learning
  and big data.

Let's move on to the learning outcomes you can expect from this course.

# Learning Outcomes
# ##############################################################################

- One of the primary goals of this course is to help you model and reason about
  data effectively. This involves understanding how to process and manipulate
  data using tools like Python and Pandas. These skills are essential for
  analyzing data and drawing meaningful conclusions.
- You will also be introduced to a variety of data models, such as relational,
  NoSQL, and graph databases. Understanding these models will help you decide
  which one is most appropriate for different applications.
- Additionally, you will learn to use data management systems like PostgreSQL,
  MongoDB, and HBase. This knowledge will enable you to choose the right system
  for various scenarios.
- Building data processing pipelines using tools like Docker and Airflow is
  another key outcome. These pipelines are crucial for handling large volumes of
  data efficiently.
- Finally, you will have the opportunity to build a big-data system from start
  to finish as part of a class project. This hands-on experience will also allow
  you to contribute to an open-source project, giving you practical experience
  in the field.

Now, let's explore the tools you will learn to use throughout this course.

# ##############################################################################
# Tools We Will Learn to Use
# ##############################################################################

- In this course, you will learn to use several programming languages and
  development tools. Python is a primary language due to its versatility and
  ease of use in data science.
- You will also become familiar with Bash/Linux OS, which is essential for
  navigating and managing files in a Unix-like environment. Git and GitHub are
  crucial for version control and collaboration, allowing you to manage code
  changes and work with others effectively. Jupyter notebooks will be used for
  interactive data analysis and visualization. Docker will help you create and
  manage containerized applications, which is important for deploying scalable
  solutions.
- The course will cover big data tools, including ETL pipelines for data
  processing, and various types of databases such as relational (PostgreSQL),
  NoSQL (HBase, MongoDB, Couchbase, Redis), and graph databases (Neo4j, GraphX,
  Giraph). You will also learn about computing frameworks like Hadoop, Spark,
  and Dask, which are essential for processing large datasets. Airflow will be
  introduced as a workflow manager, and you will explore cloud services like AWS
  for scalable computing resources.
- Tutorials will be provided for all the tools used in class projects, ensuring
  you have the guidance needed to apply these tools effectively in real-world
  scenarios.

- It's important to study the slides and materials provided for the course. This
  will help you understand the topics better and prepare for quizzes and
  projects.
- Make sure to enable notifications on the DATA605 ELMS/Canvas site. This will
  keep you updated on any announcements or changes in the course.
- Keep the contact information for the instructor and teaching assistants handy.
  This will be useful if you have questions or need help with the course
  material.
- Regularly check the DATA605 schedule to stay on top of deadlines and upcoming
  classes.
- The DATA605 GitHub repository is a valuable resource. It likely contains code
  examples, assignments, and other materials that will aid your learning.
- Review the DATA605 FAQs. They might answer common questions you have about the
  course.
- Setting up your computing environment is crucial. Install Linux or VMware and
  Docker on your laptop as instructed in the class repository. This setup will
  be necessary for completing assignments and projects.
- Bringing your laptop to class is recommended. It allows you to follow along
  with coding exercises and participate in hands-on activities.
- Although lessons are recorded, attending class when possible is beneficial. It
  provides an opportunity to ask questions and engage with the material in
  real-time.

Now, let's discuss how your performance in the course will be evaluated.

# ##############################################################################
# Grading
# ##############################################################################

- Quizzes make up 40% of your grade. They are designed to test your
  understanding of the material covered in the previous two lessons. Each quiz
  consists of 20 multiple-choice questions, and you have 20 minutes to complete
  them. There will be 4-5 quizzes throughout the semester, which encourages you
  to keep up with the material regularly.
- The final project is a significant part of your grade, accounting for 60%.
  This project requires you to apply the concepts learned in the course to a big
  data project using Python. You will choose a topic from a provided list,
  allowing you to explore an area of interest in depth. The project can be
  completed individually or as part of a group, giving you the flexibility to
  work in a way that suits your learning style.
