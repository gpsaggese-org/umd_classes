# Invariants of a Class Lecture
# ##############################################################################

- Invariants in programming and computer science are fundamental concepts that
  remain unchanged throughout the execution of a program or process.
  - This class has invariants as well, related to how we go through the material

- To aid your learning, we will use interactive Jupyter notebook tutorials.
  These tutorials are designed to be completed at home, allowing you to learn at
  your own pace. The interactive nature of Jupyter notebooks will enable you to
  experiment with code and see the effects of invariants in action.

- We will alternate between traditional slides, whiteboard discussions, and
  hands-on tutorials. This varied approach will cater to different learning
  styles and help reinforce the concepts we cover.

- Labs are an essential component of this course. They provide an opportunity to
  review complete class project examples, giving you a comprehensive
  understanding of how invariants are applied in practice. Collaboration is
  encouraged during lab sessions, allowing you to work together on class
  projects. This collaborative environment will help you develop teamwork skills
  and learn from your peers.

# ##############################################################################
# Books of the Class
# ##############################################################################

- Because AI and machine learning are improving so quickly there is not a single
  book that we can use in this class to cover the material
- The slides used in this class are derived from a variety of sources including
  books, technical articles, and the Internet
  - This means that they are designed to be comprehensive and provide all the
    necessary information you need to understand the topics being discussed
- The goal is for the slides to be self-sufficient, meaning you should be able to
  grasp the key concepts and ideas without needing to refer back to the original
  sources
- This approach ensures that you have a clear and concise understanding of the
  material, which is crucial for learning complex subjects like machine learning
  and big data.
