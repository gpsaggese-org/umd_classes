Now, let's explore how data is treated as a product in today's digital world.

# ##############################################################################
# Data as a Product
# ##############################################################################

- Many modern services rely heavily on data, essentially "selling" it as a
  product. This is evident in services powered by data and machine learning.
- Examples include personalized search engines like Google, sentiment analysis
  on platforms like Facebook, recommendation engines on Amazon, and streaming
  services like Netflix and Spotify.
- Creating data products involves several steps:
  - Data ingestion is the first step, where raw data is collected.
  - Data pre-processing follows, which includes cleaning the data, tokenizing
    it, and computing features necessary for analysis.
  - Model training is where machine learning models are developed using the
    processed data.
  - Model deployment involves putting the trained model into production, often
    managed by MLOps practices.
  - Model monitoring is crucial to ensure the model is functioning correctly,
    maintaining speed, and performing well.
  - Collecting feedback from deployment helps refine the model. For instance,
    comparing recommendations to actual user purchases can provide insights for
    future model improvements.

Let's delve deeper into the concept of data pipelines and their significance.

# ##############################################################################
# Data Pipelines
# ##############################################################################

- The phrase "Data is the new oil" highlights the value of data, but like oil,
  it needs refining to be useful.
- Data pipelines are processes that move and transform data to derive new value
  through analytics, reporting, and machine learning.
- The goal of data pipelines is to extract meaningful insights and drive
  decision-making.
- Key steps in a data pipeline include:
  - Collecting data from various sources.
  - Pre-processing or cleaning the data to ensure quality.
  - Validating the data to confirm its accuracy and reliability.
  - Processing the data to extract insights or prepare it for further analysis.
  - Combining data from different sources to provide a comprehensive view.
- Data ingestion is the simplest form of a data pipeline, involving extracting
  data, such as from a REST API, and loading it into a database like a SQL
  table.

Understanding data pipelines is crucial for effectively managing and utilizing
data in various applications.

# ##############################################################################
# Roles in Building Data Pipelines
# ##############################################################################

In the world of data pipelines, there are three main roles: data engineers, data
scientists, and data analysts. Data engineers are responsible for building and
maintaining the data pipelines. They use various tools like Python, Java, Go,
and even no-code solutions to manage data flow. They also work with different
types of databases, both SQL and NoSQL, and use big data tools like Hadoop,
MapReduce, and Spark. Cloud computing is also a significant part of their
toolkit. Data scientists, on the other hand, focus on building predictive
models. They use programming languages such as Python, R, and Julia, and like
data engineers, they also use Hadoop, MapReduce, Spark, and cloud computing.
Data analysts, who often come from backgrounds like marketing or sales, are
tasked with building metrics and dashboards. They typically use tools like Excel
and GUI tools such as Tableau to visualize data. Each role is crucial in
ensuring that data is effectively processed and utilized within an organization.

Transitioning to the next slide, let's explore some practical challenges faced
in organizing data pipelines.

# ##############################################################################
# Practical Problems in Data Pipeline Organization
# ##############################################################################

Organizing data pipelines comes with its own set of challenges. One of the
primary concerns is determining who is responsible for the data. This is crucial
for accountability and ensuring data integrity. Scaling issues are another
significant challenge, as performance, memory, and disk space can become
bottlenecks as data volume grows. Organizations often face the dilemma of
whether to build their own tools or buy existing solutions, weighing the pros
and cons of open-source versus proprietary software. The architecture of the
data pipeline is another critical aspect, requiring clear conventions and
thorough documentation. It's essential to know who is in charge of the
architecture to maintain consistency and efficiency. Service level agreements
(SLAs) are vital to ensure that data services meet the required standards.
Regular communication with stakeholders is also necessary to align the data
pipeline's objectives with business goals and to address any concerns promptly.

Now, let's delve into the process of data ingestion and its components.

# ##############################################################################
# Data Ingestion
# ##############################################################################

Data ingestion is the process of extracting data from one source and loading it
into another storage system. This is a fundamental step in building data
pipelines. Data can come from various sources, such as databases like Postgres
and MongoDB, REST APIs which provide an abstraction layer over databases,
network file systems, or cloud storage where data might be stored in formats
like CSV or Parquet files. Data warehouses and data lakes are also common
destinations for ingested data. Organizations often deal with a vast number of
data sources, ranging from a few to thousands. These sources can be internal,
such as a database storing shopping cart information for an e-commerce site, or
from third parties, like Google Analytics tracking website usage. Managing these
diverse sources requires careful planning and coordination to ensure data is
accurately and efficiently ingested into the system.

With a clear understanding of data ingestion, we can now appreciate the
complexity and importance of managing data sources effectively.

# ##############################################################################
# Data Pipeline Paradigms
# ##############################################################################

- Data pipelines are essential for processing and managing data efficiently.
  They can be built in various styles, each with its own approach to handling
  data.
- The process typically involves multiple phases: Extract, Load, and Transform.
  These phases can be arranged differently based on the philosophy or roles
  involved in data management.
- The common arrangements are ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), ELT (Extract,
  Load, Transform), and EtLT (Extract, transform, Load, Transform). Each
  arrangement has its own advantages and is chosen based on specific needs and
  goals.
- ETL is often used when data needs to be transformed before loading it into a
  data warehouse. ELT is preferred when the transformation is done after
  loading, often in a data lake. EtLT is a hybrid approach that combines
  elements of both ETL and ELT.

Understanding these paradigms helps in choosing the right approach for your data
processing needs.

# ##############################################################################
# ETL Paradigm: Phases
# ##############################################################################

- The ETL paradigm consists of three main phases: Extract, Transform, and Load.
- In the Extract phase, data is gathered from various sources such as internal
  or external data warehouses, REST APIs, or through web scraping. This phase is
  crucial for collecting all necessary data for further processing.
- The Transform phase involves converting raw data into a format that is useful
  for analysis. This may include combining data, formatting it, and applying
  business logic to make it ready for the next steps.
- The Load phase is where the transformed data is moved into its final
  destination, such as a data warehouse or data lake. This phase ensures that
  data is organized and stored in a way that is optimized for analysis.
- A data ingestion pipeline, which includes the Extract and Load phases, focuses
  on moving data from one point to another, formatting it, and making copies as
  needed. Different tools are used to operate on the data during this process.

The ETL paradigm is a foundational concept in data processing, providing a
structured approach to handling data efficiently.

# ##############################################################################
# ETL Paradigm: Example
# ##############################################################################

- In the Extract phase, organizations often face the decision of buying or
  building data ingestion tools. This decision can lead to vendor lock-in, where
  a company becomes dependent on a specific vendor's tools.
- During the Transform phase, data is converted to a usable format. This can
  involve parsing timestamps, creating new columns from existing ones, and
  applying business logic to aggregate or filter data. It's often better to add
  tags or mark data rather than filtering it out entirely. Anonymizing data is
  also a key step to ensure privacy and compliance.
- The Load phase involves organizing data in a format that is optimized for
  analysis, such as loading it into a relational database. This phase may also
  include data modeling, which structures the data for efficient querying and
  analysis.

The ETL paradigm provides a clear example of how data can be processed and
prepared for analysis, highlighting the importance of each phase in the
pipeline.

# ##############################################################################
# Workflow Orchestration
# ##############################################################################

- Companies often have numerous data pipelines, sometimes ranging from ten to
  thousands. Managing these pipelines efficiently is crucial for smooth
  operations.
- Orchestration tools like Apache Airflow, Luigi, AWS Glue, and Kubeflow are
  designed to help manage these pipelines. Each of these tools has its own
  strengths and is used by different companies to suit their specific needs.
- These tools help schedule and manage the flow of tasks based on their
  dependencies. This means that tasks are organized in a way that respects the
  order in which they need to be executed.
- Pipelines and jobs are often represented through Directed Acyclic Graphs
  (DAGs), which help visualize the flow and dependencies of tasks.
- Orchestration tools also provide features to monitor the execution of tasks,
  retry them if they fail, and send alarms to notify users of any issues. This
  ensures that any problems can be quickly identified and addressed.

Now, let's explore the shift from ETL to ELT in data processing.

# ##############################################################################
# ELT Paradigm
# ##############################################################################

- Traditionally, the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) approach has been the
  standard for data processing. This involves extracting data, transforming it
  to fit the desired format, and then loading it into a database.
- However, ETL has some drawbacks. It requires a deep understanding of the data
  at the time of ingestion and a clear idea of how the data will be used.
- The ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) approach is becoming more popular today. In
  this method, data is first extracted and loaded into a storage system, and
  then transformed as needed.
- One advantage of ELT is that it does not require knowing how the data will be
  used upfront. This allows for more flexibility in data processing.
- ELT also allows for a clear separation of roles. Data engineers can focus on
  data ingestion (extracting and loading), while data scientists and analysts
  can focus on transforming the data.
- The shift from ETL to ELT has been enabled by new technologies such as large
  cloud storage, distributed data storage and querying systems like HDFS,
  columnar databases, and data compression techniques.

Next, we'll compare row-based and columnar databases to understand their
different use cases.

# ##############################################################################
# Row-Based vs Columnar Dbs
# ##############################################################################

- Row-based databases, such as MySQL and Postgres, are optimized for reading and
  writing rows of data. They are ideal for applications that require frequent
  reading and writing of small amounts of data.
- These databases are commonly used in transactional systems where operations
  are performed on individual records.
- On the other hand, columnar databases like Amazon Redshift and Snowflake are
  designed for reading and writing large amounts of data less frequently.
- Columnar databases are particularly useful for analytical queries that require
  accessing only a few columns of data. This makes them more efficient for data
  analytics tasks.
- They also offer better data compression, which can lead to significant storage
  savings and improved performance for certain types of queries.
- Understanding the differences between row-based and columnar databases can
  help in choosing the right database for specific use cases, whether it's for
  transactional processing or analytical workloads.

# ##############################################################################
# Etlt
# ##############################################################################

- ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. This is a traditional data processing
  method where data is first extracted from various sources, then transformed
  into a suitable format, and finally loaded into a data warehouse or database.
  This approach is useful when you need to clean and structure data before
  loading it into a system.

- ELT stands for Extract, Load, Transform. In this method, data is first
  extracted and loaded into a system, and then transformed according to business
  logic. This approach is beneficial when dealing with large volumes of data, as
  it allows for more flexible and scalable transformations.

- EtLT is a variation where some transformations with limited scope are
  performed before loading. This might include tasks like removing duplicate
  records, breaking down URLs into components, or obfuscating sensitive data for
  legal or security reasons. After these initial transformations, the rest of
  the data processing follows the Load and Transform steps. This approach is
  useful when certain transformations are necessary before data can be
  effectively loaded and processed.

Now, let's explore the different types of data structures and their
implications.

# ##############################################################################
# Structure in Data (Or Lack Thereof)
# ##############################################################################

- Structured data is organized and follows a specific schema. Examples include
  relational databases, CSV files, data frames, and Parquet files. This type of
  data is easy to manage and analyze because it is consistent and predictable.

- Semi-structured data contains elements that may not follow a strict schema,
  but still have some organizational properties. Examples include logs, HTML
  pages, XML files, nested JSON, and NoSQL databases. This type of data requires
  more effort to process because it can vary in structure.

- Unstructured data lacks a predefined schema and includes formats like text,
  images, videos, and other binary large objects (blobs). This data type is the
  most challenging to work with because it requires advanced techniques to
  extract meaningful information.

Understanding data structure is crucial, but data quality is equally important.
Let's discuss data cleaning next.

# ##############################################################################
# Data Cleaning
# ##############################################################################

- Data cleanliness refers to the quality of source data, which can vary
  significantly. Data is often messy, with issues like duplicated records,
  incomplete or missing entries, inconsistent formats, and mislabeled or
  unlabeled data. These issues can affect the accuracy and reliability of data
  analysis.

- The timing of data cleaning is crucial. It can be done as soon as data is
  collected, as late as possible before analysis, or at different stages
  throughout the data processing pipeline. The choice between ETL, ELT, and EtLT
  methods can influence when and how data cleaning occurs.

- When dealing with data, it's important to use heuristics such as hoping for
  the best but assuming the worst, validating data early and often, not trusting
  any data blindly, and being defensive in data handling. These practices help
  ensure data quality and reliability.

With a solid understanding of data processing and cleaning, we can now delve
deeper into data analysis techniques.

# ##############################################################################
# OLAP vs OLTP Workloads
# ##############################################################################

- There are two main types of data workloads: OLTP and OLAP.
- OLTP stands for On-Line Transactional Processing. It is designed to handle a
  large number of transactions in real-time. This means it can process many
  small read and write operations simultaneously. Examples of OLTP systems
  include online banking, e-commerce platforms, and travel reservation systems.
  These systems need to be fast and efficient to handle many users performing
  transactions at the same time.
- On the other hand, OLAP stands for On-Line Analytical Processing. It is used
  for analyzing large volumes of data. Unlike OLTP, OLAP deals with fewer but
  larger read or write operations. This is because OLAP systems are used for
  tasks like data mining and business intelligence, where the focus is on
  analyzing data rather than processing transactions. OLAP systems help
  businesses make informed decisions by providing insights from the data.

Now, let's explore the challenges faced in managing data pipelines.

# ##############################################################################
# Challenges with Data Pipelines
# ##############################################################################

- Data pipelines face several challenges, especially when dealing with different
  data volumes. High-volume pipelines involve many small read and write
  operations, while low-volume pipelines handle fewer but larger operations.
- Another challenge is the choice between batch processing and streaming. Batch
  processing handles data in chunks at scheduled times, while streaming
  processes data in real-time, which can be demanding due to time constraints.
- API rate limits and throttling can restrict the number of requests a system
  can handle, affecting data flow.
- Connection time-outs and slow downloads can disrupt data transfer, causing
  delays.
- Managing data updates can be tricky. Incremental mode updates data as it
  changes, while catch-up mode updates data in bulk after a delay.

Let's move on to understanding the differences between data warehouses and data
lakes.

# ##############################################################################
# Data Warehouse vs Data Lake
# ##############################################################################

- A data warehouse is a database that stores data from various systems in a
  structured format. It follows the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline
  style. This means data is extracted from different sources, transformed into a
  suitable format, and then loaded into the warehouse. Examples of data
  warehouses include large Postgres instances with multiple databases and
  tables, as well as services like AWS Athena, RDS, and Google BigQuery.
- In contrast, a data lake stores data in a semi-structured or unstructured
  format. It follows the ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) data pipeline style.
  Here, data is first loaded into the lake and then transformed as needed. Data
  lakes can store a wide variety of data types, such as blog posts, flat files,
  JSON objects, and images. An example of a data lake is an AWS S3 bucket that
  holds diverse data types.

Understanding these concepts is crucial for effectively managing and analyzing
data in today's digital world.

# ##############################################################################
# Data Lake: Pros and Cons
# ##############################################################################

Data lakes are a way to store large amounts of data in a flexible manner. They
allow you to keep data in a semi-structured format or even without any structure
at all. This flexibility is one of the main advantages of data lakes. Since the
data doesn't need to fit into a predefined schema, it's easier to make changes
to the data types or properties. For example, you can store JSON documents
without worrying about how they fit into a rigid structure. This is particularly
useful for data scientists who often start by exploring raw data without knowing
exactly how they will use it. However, there are some downsides to using data
lakes. They are not as optimized for querying as structured data warehouses.
While there are tools available that allow you to query data in a data lake
using SQL-like syntax, such as AWS Athena or Redshift Spectrum, these solutions
may not be as efficient as querying a traditional data warehouse. In summary,
data lakes offer a cost-effective and flexible way to store data, but they may
not be the best choice if you need to perform complex queries frequently.

Now, let's explore the benefits and drawbacks of using cloud computing for data
management.

# ##############################################################################
# Advantages of Cloud Computing
# ##############################################################################

Cloud computing offers several advantages when it comes to building and
deploying data solutions. It simplifies the process of setting up data
pipelines, data warehouses, and data lakes. One of the key benefits is the
availability of managed services, which means you don't have to worry about
administrative tasks or deployment. These services are also highly scalable,
with options like Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Snowflake providing
robust database solutions. Another advantage is the rent-vs-buy model, which
makes it easy to scale up and out, upgrade systems, and manage cash flow more
effectively. The cost of storage and compute power is also continuously dropping
due to economies of scale, making cloud computing an attractive option. However,
there are some cons to consider. The flexibility of cloud computing comes at a
cost, often being 2 to 3 times more expensive than owning your infrastructure.
Additionally, there is the risk of vendor lock-in, where switching providers can
be difficult and costly. Overall, cloud computing offers significant benefits in
terms of ease of use and scalability, but it's important to weigh these against
the potential costs and limitations.
