# Stochastic processes

* Random Variables and Index Sets
  - A stochastic process is a collection of random variables indexed by time or space
  - Indexed set: $\{X_t : t \in T\}$ where $T$ can be discrete or continuous
  - Describes evolving random phenomena
  - Example: daily temperature, stock prices

* Markov Chains
  - Memoryless stochastic process: $P(X_{t+1} | X_t, ..., X_0) = P(X_{t+1} | X_t)$
  - Characterized by a transition matrix $P$
  - Types: discrete-time, continuous-time
  - Applications: web ranking, genetic modeling, board games

* Stationarity
  - A process is stationary if its statistical properties do not change over time
  - Strict stationarity: joint distribution invariant under time shift
  - Weak stationarity: constant mean and autocovariance depend only on lag
  - Important in time-series modeling and signal processing

* Martingales
  - Process with conditional expectation: $\mathbb{E}[X_{t+1} | X_1, ..., X_t] = X_t$
  - Models fair games and conservative estimates
  - Used in financial modeling and online learning

* Poisson Process
  - Models arrival of random events in continuous time
  - Events occur independently with constant average rate $\lambda$
  - Interarrival times are exponentially distributed
  - Applications: queuing theory, rare event modeling

* Brownian Motion (Wiener Process)
  - Continuous-time stochastic process with stationary, independent Gaussian increments
  - Starts at 0: $B_0 = 0$
  - Used in modeling diffusion, stock prices, reinforcement learning
  - Foundation for stochastic differential equations

* Autoregressive (AR) Processes
  - $X_t$ depends linearly on its past values: $X_t = \sum_{i=1}^p \phi_i X_{t-i} + \epsilon_t$
  - $\epsilon_t$ is white noise
  - Common in time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA)

* Moving Average (MA) Processes
  - $X_t$ is a linear function of current and past noise: $X_t = \sum_{i=0}^q \theta_i \epsilon_{t-i}$
  - Used to model short-term dependencies
  - Often combined with AR in ARMA/ARIMA models

* Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
  - Markov chain with unobserved (hidden) states
  - Observations are generated from state-dependent distributions
  - Used in speech recognition, bioinformatics, and NLP

* Gaussian Processes
  - A collection of random variables, any finite number of which are jointly Gaussian
  - Fully specified by a mean function and covariance kernel
  - Used in Bayesian regression, spatial modeling, and active learning

* Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)
  - Differential equations with random noise
  - General form: $dX_t = \mu(X_t, t)dt + \sigma(X_t, t)dB_t$
  - Models continuous-time random phenomena
  - Applications: physics, finance, control theory

* Ergodicity
  - Time averages equal ensemble averages under certain conditions
  - Ensures statistical estimation is feasible from a single realization
  - Crucial for learning from time-series data

* Renewal Processes
  - Generalization of Poisson processes
  - Interarrival times are i.i.d. but not necessarily exponential
  - Used in reliability theory and system maintenance

* Birth-Death Processes
  - Special case of Markov chains with transitions to neighboring states
  - Models population dynamics, queue lengths
  - Characterized by birth rate $\lambda_n$ and death rate $\mu_n$

* Queueing Models
  - Systems where entities wait in line for service
  - Described using stochastic processes (e.g., M/M/1 queue)
  - Analyzed via arrival and service rate distributions
  - Applied in networks, servers, and traffic modeling

* Random Walks
  - Discrete stochastic process: $X_{t+1} = X_t + \epsilon_t$
  - $\epsilon_t$ is typically i.i.d. and symmetric
  - Central to modeling cumulative processes and diffusion

* Time Series Analysis
  - Study of data indexed by time with inherent stochasticity
  - Techniques: decomposition, smoothing, forecasting
  - Used in econometrics, forecasting, and anomaly detection

* Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem
  - Justify convergence and Gaussian approximations of stochastic processes
  - Law of large numbers: sample mean converges to expected value
  - CLT: sum of i.i.d. variables approximates a normal distribution

* Monte Carlo Methods
  - Use stochastic sampling to approximate expectations and distributions
  - Key for Bayesian inference and simulation
  - Methods include importance sampling and MCMC

* Filtering and Prediction
  - Estimate current or future states from noisy observations
  - Includes Kalman filters (linear-Gaussian) and particle filters (nonlinear)
  - Essential in control, robotics, and state estimation
