# Time Series

## Basic definition

* Time Series
- A **time series** is a sequence of observations over time, e.g.,
  - Finance: Hourly stock prices
  - Web Analytics: Number of active users on a site sampled every minute
  - Manufacturing: Sensor data from machinery (e.g., temperature or vibration)
  - Weather: Daily temperature measurements
  - Energy: Daily electricity usage of a household

- You need time series only for things that change over time
  - Everything in the real world (besides mathematical objects) changes over
    time
  - You need time series for pretty much everything!

* Time Series
- A time series is modeled as a random process, a sequence of random variables
  indexed by time:
  $$\{ Y_t \}_{t=-\infty}^{\infty}$$
  - Variables can be continuous or discrete
  - Data is typically equi-spaced in time
  - The time dimension matters since random variables exhibit dependence over
    time

- **Goals:**
  - Understand patterns
    - Identify trends, seasonality, and cyclic behavior
    - Detect anomalies or outliers
  - Predict future values
    - Forecast future data points based on historical patterns
    - E.g., predicting next month's sales based on past sales data
  - Improve decision-making
    - Use insights from the time series to make informed business or policy
      decisions
    - E.g., adjusting inventory levels based on predicted demand

* Time Series: Visualization and Exploration
- **Visualization:**
  - Guides preprocessing choices
  - Helps form hypotheses before modeling
  - Distinguishes between underlying structure and randomness

- **Patterns:**
  - **Trend**: Long-term increase or decrease
  - **Seasonality**: Repeating patterns at regular intervals
  - **Noise**: Random fluctuations

- **Line plots** show raw data over time, e.g.,
  - Trend presence
  - Outliers or abrupt changes

- **Seasonal plots** reveal periodic patterns
  - E.g., plot monthly sales to find yearly seasonality

- **Autocorrelation plots** detect repeating structures

* Autocovariance
- The $j$-lag **autocovariance** of a time series $\{Y_t\}$ is the covariance of
  a random variable and the variable $j$ samples before:
  $$\Cov(Y_t, Y_{t-j}) \defeq \EE[(Y_t - \EE[Y_t]) (Y_{t-j} - \EE[Y_{t-j}])]$$
  - Represent how a variable varies over time
  - Linear relationship

- The $j$-lag **autocorrelation** of a time series $\{Y_t\}$ is:
  $$
  \Corr(Y_t, Y_{t-j})
  = \rho(Y_t, Y_{t-j})
  \defeq \frac{\Cov(Y_t, Y_{t-j})}{\sqrt{\VV[Y_t] \VV[Y_{t-j}]}}
  $$
  - Measure strength and direction of the linear relationship between samples
  - Scale-free

* Stationarity: Intuition
- A time series $\{Y_t\}$ is **stationary** if some statistical properties (e.g.,
  mean, variance, autocorrelation structure) do not change over time
  - I.e., the time series is "unchanged" by shifts in time
  - Stationarity is analogous to IID sampling for random variables

- Time series are rarely stationary
  - Stationarity is often an approximation/simplification of reality

- **Why important:**
  - Many models (e.g., ARIMA) assume stationarity
  - E.g., raw stock prices are non-stationary, returns often are

- **Tests for stationarity:**
  - ADF Test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller): tests for unit root
  - KPSS Test: tests for trend stationarity

* Strictly Stationary: Definition
- A time series $\{Y_t\}$ is **strictly stationary** iff for any any set of
  $r > 0$ indices $t_1, t_2, ..., t_r < t$, the joint distribution of
  $(Y_{t_1}, Y_{t_2}, ..., Y_{t_r})$ depends only on the differences $t_1 - t_2,
  ..., t_1 - t_r$

- E.g.,
  - $(Y_1, Y_5)$ has the same joint distribution as $(Y_{12}, Y_{16})$
  - $(Y_1, Y_2, Y_3)$ has the same joint distribution as $(Y_3, Y_4, Y_5)$

- **Intuition**:
  - The data (i.e., joint probability of any set of observations) is invariant
    when we shift it in time
  - Only the distances in time matter

- If $\{Y_t\}$ is strictly stationary:
  - All moments (e.g., mean, variance) of $Y_t$ don't depend on $t$
  - Any statistics between lags of the time series depend only on the difference
    in time between lags

* Weakly Stationary: Definition
- **Weakly stationarity** requires milder assumptions than for strictly
  stationary process:

  1. The mean is constant over time:
     $$\EE[Y_t] = \mu \; \forall t$$
  2. The variance is constant over time:
     $$\VV[Y_t] = \sigma^2 \; \forall t$$
  3. The $j$-lag autocovariance $\Cov(Y_t, Y_{t-j})$ depends on distance
     between lags $j$ but not on $t$:
     $$\Cov(Y_t, Y_{t-j}) = \gamma_j$$

- In practice, there is a constraint only on:
  - First and second moments
  - The joint distribution of 2 time indices

- **Intuition**:
  - No trend (mean is constant)
  - Variations around the mean have constant amplitude (variance is constant)
  - Consistent wiggling (random patterns look the same)

* Auto-Correlation Function (ACF)
- **Auto-correlation function** (ACF) is a graphical representation of the
  $i$-lag autocorrelation of a time series
  - Plot the correlation coefficient of a time series with its own lagged values
  - (Ideally) Plot the uncertainty of the coefficients
  - Helps identify repetitive patterns or seasonality in the data
  - E.g., for a time series of daily temperatures, the ACF can help you see if
    today's temperature is correlated with the temperature from previous days

- **Partial Auto-Correlation Function** (PACF) is like ACF but controls for the
  values of the time series at all shorter lags
  $$\alpha(k) = \Corr(Y_t - Proj_{t,k}(Y_t), Y_{t-k} - Proj_{t,k}(Y_{t,k}))$$
  where:
  - $Proj_{t,k}(x)$ is the projection of $x$ onto the space spanned by
    $(x_{t}, ..., x_{t-k+1})$
  - Helps understand the direct relationship between a time series and its
    lagged values, excluding the influence of intermediate lags
  - E.g., in a sales data time series, PACF can help identify the direct impact
    of sales from a specific previous month on the current month's sales,
    without the influence of other months in between

* Transformation of a time series
- Any deterministic transformation $g(\cdot)$ of a strictly (weakly) stationary
  process $\{Y_t\}$ is also strictly (weakly) stationary

- **Examples**:
  - Log transformations useful when data grows exponentially
  - Differencing removes trend and makes series stationary
    - First difference: $z_t = y_t - y_{t-1}$
  - Power transformations (e.g., square root) can reduce skewness
  - Detrending
    - Subtract a fitted trend line
    - Apply moving average smoothing

- A transformation can make a process stationary, e.g.,
  - Detrending
  - Differencing (integral or fractional)

## Time series operators
## ############################################################################

* Lag Operator
- Aka "shift back", backshift, delay
- Given a time series $\{ X_t \}$, the lag operator $L(\cdot)$ generates another
  time series:
  $$Y_t = L X_t = X_{t-1}$$

- **Intuition**
  - Lagging a time series means that the $t$ (today) element of the new time
    series is the $t - 1$ (yesterday) element of the old time series
  - It delays the time series

- The "normal" direction (i.e., positive delay) is delaying, since you are not
  snooping in the future
  - `pd.shift(n>0)` with a positive sign
    \begingroup \scriptsize
    ```text
    date        val     val.shift(2)
    2016-03-10  0       nan
    2016-03-11  1       nan
    2016-03-14  2       0

    ```
    \endgroup
  - The values at the beginning of the period are not available since they require
    data before the period of interest

* Lead Operator
- Aka "shift forward"
- It is accomplished by:
  $$Y_t = L^{-1} X_t = X_{t+1}$$
  - When using a variable function of time, the transformation is like $x(t + 2)$
    since the value today $x(0)$ is the value computed in the future $x(2)$

- When you shift forward (lead) `df.shift(n<0)`, you move a value from the future
  (a value computed $n$ periods in the future) to today
  \begingroup \scriptsize
  ```
  date        val     val.shift(-2)
  2016-03-10  0       2
  2016-03-11  1       3

  2016-03-16  4       nan
  ```
  \endgroup
- This is equivalent to "shifting up" a time series ordered by increasing dates
  - Some values at the end of the period won't be available since they would
    have been computed after the period of interest is over
  - Some values computed at the beginning of the period will be discarded

* Shifting More Than One Time Step
- You can shift more than one lag with:
  $$L^k X_t = X_{t-k}$$
  $$L^{-k} X_t = X_{t+k}$$

- Important points:
  - $L^k$ represents a backward shift by $k$ time steps
  - $L^{-k}$ represents a forward shift by $k$ time steps

- E.g., if $X_t$ is a time series:
  - $L^2 X_t = X_{t-2}$ shifts the data point two steps back
  - $L^{-3} X_t = X_{t+3}$ shifts the data point three steps forward

* Difference Operator
- The first difference of a time series is defined as the time series:
  $$Y_t = \Delta X_t \defeq X_t - X_{t-1}$$
  i.e., the time series that is the difference between the original time series
  and its lagged version

- The first difference can be written in terms of lag operator as:
  $$\Delta X_t = (1 - L) X_t$$

- **Intuition**:
  - Differencing means computing the difference between consecutive observations:
    $$Y_t = X_t - X_{t-1}$$
  - This means removing the changes in the level of a time series
    - Eliminate trend and seasonality, which stabilize the mean of the time
      series
    - Differencing can make a time series stationary


* Second Difference Operator
- The second difference is defined as:
  $$\Delta^2 X_t = \Delta (\Delta X_t)$$

- Note that the second difference is not the difference $Y_t - Y_{t-2}$
  - Developing:
    $$Y_t = \Delta X_t = X_t - X_{t-1}$$
    and
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    Z_t &= Y_t - Y_{t - 1} \\
    &= X_t - X_{t - 1} - (X_{t - 1} - X_{t - 2}) \\
    &= X_t - 2 X_{t - 1} + X_{t - 2}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

- The second difference operator can be written in terms of lag operator as:
  $$\Delta^2 X_t = (1 - L)^2 X_t$$

* N-th Difference Operator
- The $n$-th difference operator is defined:
  $$\Delta^n X_t = (1 - L)^n X_t$$

- The notation highlights that you can express the $n$-th difference operator in
  terms of $n$-th power of the difference operator

## Time series decomposition

* Decomposition of Time Series
- A time series can be broken into several components:
  $$y_t = \text{Trend}_t + \text{Seasonality}_t + \text{Cycle}_t + \text{Residual}_t$$
  - **Trend**
    - Long-term increase or decrease in data
    - Can change direction over time
  - **Seasonality**
    - Affected by seasonal factors (e.g., time of day, day of week, month of
      year)
    - Fixed and known frequency
  - **Cycle**
    - Value rises and falls without fixed frequency
    - E.g., economic conditions exhibit cycles
  - **Residual (noise)**
    - Everything that is left after removing the other components
    - Idiosyncratic component

- Besides additive model, the components can also be mixed in different ways
  (e.g., multiplicative)

* Seasonality: Example
::: columns
:::: {.column width=50%}
- Consider sales of antidiabetic drug over time
  - Sharp spike in January
  - Dip in February
  - Increase over the year

- **Why?**
  - In January, government subsidy makes it cost-effective to stockpile drugs
  - In February, dip occurs as people have already bought many drugs
  - Demand increases until December as people use their reserves
  - Then the cycle repeats next year

::::
:::

* Cycle: Example
- Gross Domestic Product (GDP) moves around its long-term growth trend
  - The fluctuation is the business cycle
  - Understanding these cycles aids in economic planning and forecasting

- Different cycles:
  - **Inventory**: 3-5 years
    - Driven by inventory level changes in response to demand fluctuations
    - E.g., a retailer overstocks during high demand and then reduce orders,
      leading to a cycle
  - **Fixed investment**: 7-11 years
    - Investments in long-term assets like machinery and buildings
    - E.g., a manufacturing company invests in new machinery every decade to
      improve efficiency
  - **Infrastructural investment**: 15-25 years
    - Large-scale infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, and public
      utilities
    - E.g., a government plans a major highway expansion every 20 years to
      accommodate growing traffic
  - **Technological investment**: 45-60 years
    - Major technological advancements and their adoption across industries
    - E.g., the widespread adoption of the Internet in 1995-2010

* Seasonal Plot
- Seasonal plot allows understanding the model structure over time

::: columns
:::: {.column width=50%}
- Assume you know the periodicity of a signal
  - E.g., yearly periodicity of a monthly time series

- Partition the time-series based on the periodicity:
  - Plot each time series chunk on the same graph

- **Questions:**
  - Do the data exhibit a seasonal pattern?
  - Is there a within-group pattern (e.g., Jan and July exhibit similar
    patterns)?
  - Are there outliers after accounting for seasonality?
  - Is the seasonality changing over time?

* Seasonal Differencing
::: columns
:::: {.column width=45%}
- Take the difference between observations at the same point of consecutive
  periods
  - E.g., for time series with yearly periodicity, take the Year-over-Year (YoY)
    difference

  (e.g., retail sales or temperature data)
  - Help identify underlying trends by eliminating seasonal fluctuations

# Classical Methods

## Simple Models for Stochastic Process

* White Noise Process
- Defined as:
  $$\{ Y_t \} \sim \WN(0, \sigma^2)$$

- Each $Y_t$ is:
  - A IID random variable at time $t$
    - Independent over time
    - Drawn from the same distribution 
      $Y_t \sim \text{ IID from distribution } F$ (not necessarily Gaussian)
  - With mean $\EE[Y_t] = 0$ and constant variance $\VV[Y_t] = \sigma^2$

- **Key points:**
  - It's strictly stationary
  - $\{ Y_t \}$ is uncorrelated over time
  - Variance $\sigma^2$ is constant for all $t$
  - $\Cov(Y_t, Y_{t-j}) = \gamma_j = 0 \text{ for } j \ne 0$

- It's called "white noise" because:
  - There is no pattern ("noise")
  - Signal spectrum contains all frequencies with equal power (analogous to
    "white light")

* Deterministically Trending Process
- Defined as:
  $$Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \varepsilon_t$$
  where:
  - The noise is Gaussian: $\varepsilon_t \sim \GWN(0, \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2)$
  - The noise term is also called "innovation" or "error term"
  - $\beta_0$ is the intercept of the model
  - $\beta_1$ is the slope of the model, representing the trend over time
  - $t$ is the time index

- The mean $\EE[Y_t] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t$ depends on $t$
  - It is non-stationary in the mean due to the presence of the trend component
    $\beta_1 t$, e.g.,
  - $\beta_1 > 0$ indicates an upward trend
  - $\beta_1 < 0$ indicates a downward trend
- The variance of the noise term $\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2$ is constant over
  time

* Random Walk
- Defined as
  $$Y_t = Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t$$
  where
  - The noise is Gaussian: $\varepsilon_t \sim \GWN(0, \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2)$

- It can be rewritten in terms of the noise terms doing a recursive substitution:
  $$Y_t = Y_0 + \sum_{i=1}^t \varepsilon_i$$

- The mean is constant: $\EE[Y_t] = \EE[Y_0] = \mu$
- The variance is $\VV[Y_t] = t \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2$ since all the covariances
  between innovations are 0
  - It is non-stationary in the variance

## Autoregressive models

* Autoregressive (AR) Models
- An AR model of order $p$ expresses future values using past $p$ values:
  \begin{alignat*}{2}
  y_t & = c + \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \phi_2 y_{t-2} + \dots + \phi_p y_{t-p} + \varepsilon_t \\
  & = c + \sum_{i=1}^p \phi_i Y_{t-i} + \varepsilon_t \\
  \end{alignat*}
  where:
  - $y_t$ is the value at time $t$
  - $c$ is a constant
  - $\phi_1, \phi_2, \dots, \phi_p$ are the model parameters
  - $y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}, \dots, y_{t-p}$ are past values (aka lags)
  - Random error term is white noise 
    $\varepsilon_t \sim \text{ IID } Normal(0, \sigma^2)$ 

- E.g., predicting temperature today using temperature for past 3 days:
  $$y_t = c + \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \phi_2 y_{t-2} + \phi_3 y_{t-3} + \varepsilon_t$$

* AR(1) process
- Aka "auto-regressive of order 1"
- AR(1) model is defined as:
  $$Y_t = c + \phi Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t$$
  where
  - the model is an autoregressive term plus noise
  - the noise is IID Gaussian
    $\varepsilon_t \sim \GWN(0, \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2)$

- It is regressive with respect to itself, i.e., "auto-regressive"
  - The representation:
    $$Y_t = \phi Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t$$
    can be thought as a regression of $Y_t$ against $Y_{t-1}$

* AR(1) process: mean
- Applying the expected value to the definition of AR(1) 
  $$Y_t = c + \phi Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t$$
  you get:
  $$\EE[Y_t] = c + \phi \EE[Y_{t-1}] + \EE[\varepsilon_t]$$
- Assuming the mean exists and it's $\mu$, then $\mu = c + \phi \mu$ so:
  $$\EE[Y_t] = \frac{c}{1 - \phi}$$

* AR(1) process: in terms of mean
- Rewriting the AR(1) model:
  $$Y_t = c + \phi Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t$$
  using the relationship for the mean:
  $$\mu = \frac{c}{1 - \phi}$$
  you get:
  $$Y_t = \mu (1 - \phi) + \phi Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t$$

- Rewriting in terms of difference from the mean:
  $$(Y_t - \mu) = \phi \cdot (Y_{t-1} - \mu) + \varepsilon_t$$
  - It is like random walk $Y_t = Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t$ but with a mean $\mu$
    and a param $\phi$

* AR(1) process: properties
- Using the definition of model in terms of the mean:
  $$Y_t = \mu (1 - \phi) + \phi Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t$$
  you can compute the statistical properties of AR(1) process:
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  & \EE[Y_t] = \mu \\
  & \VV[Y_t] = \frac{\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2}{1 - \phi^2} \\
  & \Cov[Y_t, Y_{t-j}] = \VV[Y_t] \phi^j \\
  & \rho(Y_t, Y_{t-j}) = \phi^j \\
  \end{aligned}
  $$

- If $-1 < \phi < 1$, the AR(1) model is weakly stationary 

* AR(1) process is mean-reverting
- Mean-reverting means that when the value is far from the mean, it tends to go
  back
  - The speed of mean reversion depends on $\phi$

// Add pic

* AR(1) Process Approximates Ergodicity
- Ergodicity is a property of time series where $Y_t$ and $Y_{t-j}$ become
  independent as $j$ grows large enough
  - "Memory" fades over time

- The autocorrelation of AR(1) has a geometric decay:
  $$\Cov[Y_t, Y_{t-j}] = \VV[Y_t] \phi^j$$
  i.e., variables that are closer in time are more correlated than variables
  that are farther in time
  - If $j \to \infty$ then $\Cov[Y_t, Y_{t-j}] \to 0$ (ergodicity)

* AR(1) Process vs Gaussian White Noise
- The Gaussian White Noise (GWN) is choppy
- The AR(1) process is smoother than the GWN due to the autocorrelation in time

- AR(1) as function of $\phi$:
  - $\phi = 0$: white noise, it bounces around the mean
  - $0 < \phi < 1$: it stays far from the mean and then reverts (it is smoother)
  - $\phi = 1$: random walk, it walks away from the mean
  - $\phi > 1$: explosive progress since it diverges accelerating
  - $\phi < 0$:it is super choppy

// Add pic

* AR(1) to model financial time series
- Good model for:
  - Interest rates
  - Growth rate of macroeconomic variables (e.g., GDP, unemployment rate)
  - Profit and losses

- Bad model for:
  - Stocks don't show a strong time dependency
    - Returns look like white noise
    - Prices look like random walk

* AR(p) model
- AR(p) is an autoregressive model of order $p$:
  $$
  Y_t = c + \sum_{i=1}^p \phi_i Y_{t-i} + \varepsilon_t
  $$
  where
  - $\varepsilon$ terms are white noise

- In words, AR(p) models are linear combination of $p$ past realization plus
  noise

- AR models assume the time series is stationary:
  - Partial Autocorrelation Function helps choose $p$
  - Model parameters are estimated using methods like Ordinary Least Squares
    (OLS) or Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

* AR(p) model in terms of lag operator
- The AR(p) equation is:
  $$
  Y_t = c + \sum_{i=1}^p \phi_i Y_{t-i} + \varepsilon_t
  $$
- Separating var and noise term
  $$
  Y_t - \sum \phi_i Y_{t-i} = c + \varepsilon_t
  $$
- Using lag operator
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  Y_t - \sum \phi_i L^i Y_t &= \\
  (1 - \sum \phi_i L^i) Y_t &= \\
  \text{polynomial}(\phi, L) Y_t &= c + \varepsilon_t\\
  \end{aligned}
  $$

## Moving average models

* Moving Average (MA) Models
- A MA model of order $q$ predicts the next value using past $q$ errors:
  \begin{alignat*}{2}
  Y_t
  & = \mu + \varepsilon_t + \theta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1} + \theta_2 \varepsilon_{t-2} + \dots + \theta_q \varepsilon_{t-q} \\
  & = \mu + \varepsilon_t + \sum_{i=1}^q \theta_i \varepsilon_{t-i} \\
  \end{alignat*}
  where:
  - $\mu$ is the mean of the series
  - $\varepsilon_t$ is the white noise error term at time $t$
  - $\theta_1, \theta_2, \dots, \theta_q$ are the parameters of the model

- E.g., correcting for sensor noise by using past error patterns
  - If a sensor consistently overestimates by a small amount, the MA model can
    adjust for this by considering past errors

- MA models are always stationary
  - Suitable for time series data where the impact of a shock is short-lived
  - Useful for modeling time series with short-term dependencies

* MA(1) process: def
- Aka "moving average of order 1"
- MA(1) model is defined as:
  $$
  Y_t = c + \varepsilon_t + \theta \varepsilon_{t-1}
  $$
  where the noise is iid Gaussian:
  $\varepsilon_t \sim \GWN(0, \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2)$

- Why is it called moving average?
  - Consider:
    \begin{alignat*}{2}
    Y_t = c + \varepsilon_{t} + \theta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1} + \theta_2 \varepsilon_{t-2} \\
    Y_{t-1} = c + \varepsilon_{t-1} + \theta_1 \varepsilon_{t-2} + \theta_2 \varepsilon_{t-3} \\
    \end{alignat*}
  - It's like a window with given coefficients (computing an average), moving in time

* MA(1) process: properties
- Using the definitions we obtain:
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  & \EE[Y_t] = c \\
  & \VV[Y_t] = (1 + \theta) \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2 \\
  & \Cov[Y_t, Y_{t-1}] = \theta \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2 \\
  & \Cov[Y_t, Y_{t-j}] = 0, \; \forall j > 1 \\
  \end{aligned}
  $$

- It is a weakly stationary process since:
    - Mean and variance are constant
    - The covariance depends only on the difference of the lags

* MA(q) model
- MA(q) is a moving average model of order $q$:
  $$
  Y_t = c  + \varepsilon_t + \sum_{i=1}^p \theta_i \varepsilon_{t - i}
  $$
  where:
  - $c$ is the mean
  - $\varepsilon$ terms are white noise
- In words, MA(q) models are linear combination of $q$ error terms from the past

- Intuition of covariance structure
  - In general MA(q) has dependency between consecutive terms $Y_t$ up to $Y_{t-q}$
  - It can be seen by considering
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    & Y_t = f(\varepsilon_t, \varepsilon_{t-1}, ..., \varepsilon_{t-q}) \\
    & ... \\
    & Y_{t-k} = f(\varepsilon_{t-k}, \varepsilon_{t-k-1}, ..., \varepsilon_{t-k-q}) \\
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    and noticing that there are common terms as long $t - k \le t - q \iff k \le q$

* MA(q) model in terms of lag operator
- The MA equation is:
  $$
  Y_t = \mu + \varepsilon_t + \sum_{i=1}^q \theta_i \varepsilon_{t-i}
  $$
- Using the lag operator:
  $$
  Y_t
  = \mu + (1 + \sum_{i=1}^q \theta_i L^i) \varepsilon_i
  = \mu + f(\theta, L) \varepsilon_i
  $$

## ############################################################################
## ARMA(p, q) process
## ############################################################################

* ARMA(p, q) model
- It contains $p$ autoregressive terms and $q$ moving average terms:
  $$ARMA(p, q) = AR(p) + MA(q)$$
  where:
  - AR part involves regressing the variable on its own lagged values
  - MA part models error term as a linear combination of lagged error terms
- A realization of an ARMA(p, q) process is:
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  Y_t
  & = AR(p) + MA(q) \\
  & = (c + \sum_{i=1}^p \phi_i Y_{t-i} + \varepsilon_t) +
  (c + \sum_{i=1}^q \theta_i \varepsilon_{t-i} + \varepsilon_t) \\
  & = c + \sum_{i=1}^p \phi_i Y_{t-i} +
  \sum_{i=1}^q \theta_i \varepsilon_{t-i} + \varepsilon_t \\
  \end{aligned}
  $$

- In terms of lag operator:
  $$
  (1 - \sum_{i=1}^q \phi_i L^i) Y_t
  = c + (1 + \sum_{i=1}^p \theta_i L^i) \varepsilon_i
  $$

* Residuals of ARMA model
- Residuals should be uncorrelated and normally distributed
- One can check the ACF of the residuals

* ARIMA Models
- Consider $ARIMA(p, d, q)$ where:
  - $p$: number of autoregressive terms (AR)
  - $d$: order of differencing (I)
  - $q$: number of moving average terms (MA)

- From ARMA to ARIMA
  - ARMA models combine AR and MA components, using the lag operator:
    $$
    (1 - \sum_{i=1}^q \phi_i L^i) Y_t
    = c + (1 + \sum_{i=1}^p \theta_i L^i) \varepsilon_i
    $$
  - The $d$-order differencing is $(1 - L)^d$ in terms of lag operator

- ARIMA models extend ARMA by including differencing:
  $$
  \begin{cases}
  Z_t = (1 - L)^d Y_t \\
  (1 - \sum_{i=1}^p \phi_i L^i) Z_t = c + (1 + \sum_{i=1}^q \theta_i L^i) \varepsilon_t \\
  \end{cases}
  $$
  - Compute the final polynomials
    $$poly_{\Phi}(\phi, L)(1 - L)^d Y_t = c + poly_{\Theta}(\theta, L) \varepsilon_i$$
  - Transform back into delays

* ARIMA Models: Differencing
- Differencing stabilizes the time series by handling non-stationary data
  - Over-differencing increases model complexity without improving accuracy
  - Under-differencing results in a non-stationary series
  - E.g., if a time series shows a linear trend, first-order differencing
    ($d = 1$) might be sufficient to achieve stationarity

- Can model and forecast a wide range of time series data
  - Setting $p$, $d$, or $q$ to 0, ARIMA is simplified to a ARMA, AR, I, MA model
  - ARIMA(0, 0, 0)
    - $Y_t = \varepsilon_t$, which is white noise
  - ARIMA(0, 1, 0) = I(1)
      - $Y_t = Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t$, which is a random walk
  - ARIMA(p, 0, q) = ARMA(p, q)

* SARIMA
- Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) extends ARIMA to handle seasonal patterns in time
  series data
- $SARIMA(p, d, q) \times (P, D, Q, s)$ where
  - $p$: order of non-seasonal AR (autoregressive) terms
  - $d$: number of non-seasonal differences
  - $q$: order of non-seasonal MA (moving average) terms
  - $P$: order of seasonal AR terms
  - $D$: number of seasonal differences
  - $Q$: order of seasonal MA terms
  - $s$: length of the seasonal cycle
    - E.g., 12 for monthly data with yearly seasonality

- It incorporates seasonal autoregressive and moving average terms, as well as
  seasonal differencing
  - Useful when strong periodic behavior exists
  - Seasonal differencing removes seasonal patterns: $y'_t = y_t - y_{t-s}$
  - E.g., forecasting monthly airline passenger data

// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Jenkins_method
* Fitting ARMA / ARIMA models
- The original Box-Jenkins approach has 3 phases:
  1. Model identification / selection
     - Select $p, d, q$
     - Identify seasonality
     - Difference data, if necessary, to achieve stationarity
     - Check if variables are stationary
     - Use ACF, PACF to decide AR and MA components to use
  2. Parameter estimation
     - Pick coefficients to get best fit
  3. Model checking
     - Test estimated model
     - E.g., the residual should have no serial correlation and be stationary in
       mean and variance
     - If estimation is inadequate, go back to step 1) and attempt to build a
       better model

## ############################################################################
## ARCH model
## ############################################################################

* ARCH: Intuition
- Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH)
- ARCH is used to model time series that exhibit:
  - Time-varying volatility
  - Volatility clustering (periods of swings interspersed with periods of calm)

- Variance of error term (aka innovation) is described as a function of the value
  of the previous time periods error terms
    $$\VV[\varepsilon_t] = f(\varepsilon_{t-1}, ..., \varepsilon_{t-N})$$
- E.g., error variance follows an AR model

* ARCH(q): definition
- The model for the error term of the time series is:
  $$\varepsilon_t = \sigma_t \cdot z_t$$
  where:
    - $z_t$ is white noise process (stochastic part)
    - $\sigma_t^2$ is the time-dependent variance given by an AR(q) model:
        $$\begin{aligned}
        \sigma_t^2
        &= \alpha_0 + \sum_{i=1}^q \alpha_i \varepsilon_{t-i}^2 \\
        &= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \varepsilon_{t-1}^2 + ... +
        \alpha_q \varepsilon_{t-q}^2 \\
        &\text{ where } \alpha_i \ge 0
        \end{aligned}$$
- The error variance is AR(q), i.e., a linear combination of squares of previous
  error term realizations

* GARCH(p, q): definition
- GARCH stands for Generalized ARCH
  - The error variance follows an ARMA model

- The error term of a time series is modeled as:
  $$\varepsilon_t = \sigma_t \cdot z_t$$
  where:
  - $z_t$ is white noise process (stochastic part)
  - $\sigma_t^2$ is the time-dependent variance given by an ARMA(p, q) model
    $$\begin{aligned}
    \sigma_t^2
    &= \omega +
    \sum_{i=1}^q \alpha_i \varepsilon_{t-i}^2 +
    \sum_{i=1}^p \beta_i \sigma_{t-i}^2 \\
    \end{aligned}$$

* Exponential Smoothing Model
- Exponential smoothing is a time series forecasting method using weighted
  averages of past observations
  - More recent observations get more weight
  - Weights decrease exponentially for older data
  \begin{alignat*}{2}
  & \hat{y_t}
  = \alpha y_t + \alpha(1 - \alpha) y_{t-1} + \alpha(1 - \alpha)^2 y_{t-2} + \cdots \\
  & = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \alpha (1 - \alpha)^k y_{t - k} \\
  \end{alignat*}
- **Interpretation**
  - $\alpha$: smoothing parameter ($0 < \alpha < 1$)
  - Most recent observations have the greatest influence on forecast
  - Suitable for series with no trend or seasonality
- It can be expressed in a recursive formulation:
  \begin{alignat*}{2}
  \hat{y}_{t+1} = z_t \\
  z_t = \alpha y_t + (1 - \alpha) z_{t-1} \\
  \end{alignat*}

* Additive Holt-Winters Model
- Extends exponential smoothing to capture trend and seasonality (seasonal
  variation is roughly constant over time)
- Components of the model:
  - Level $\ell_t$: the baseline value at time $t$
  - Trend $b_t$: the slope or direction of the series
  - Seasonal component $s_t$: repeated patterns over a fixed period
- Forecast equation:
  $$
  \hat{y}_{t+h} = \ell_t + h b_t + s_{t+h - m(k+1)}
  $$
  where:
  - $m$: season length
  - $h$: forecast horizon
- Update equations:
  - Level: $\ell_t = \alpha (y_t - s_{t-m}) + (1 - \alpha)(\ell_{t-1} + b_{t-1})$
  - Trend: $b_t = \beta (\ell_t - \ell_{t-1}) + (1 - \beta)b_{t-1}$
  - Season: $s_t = \gamma (y_t - \ell_t) + (1 - \gamma)s_{t-m}$

* Additive Holt-Winters Model: Use
- Intuition:
  - Smoothly updates estimates of level, trend, and season
  - Each component has its own smoothing parameter: $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$
- Additive nature:
  - Adds components together: $y_t = \ell_t + b_t + s_t + \varepsilon_t$
  - Good for stable seasonal effects (e.g., monthly sales with similar variation)
- Common applications:
  - Retail sales
  - Web traffic
  - Electricity demand with fixed seasonal amplitude
  - Daily demand with seasonal shopping patterns

* Vector Autoregressions (VAR)
- VAR models generalize AR models to multivariate time series
  - Each variable depends on past values of itself and others
  - E.g., for 2 variables
    \begin{alignat*}{2}
    y_{1,t} &= c_1 + \phi_{11} y_{1,t-1} + \phi_{12} y_{2,t-1} + \varepsilon_{1,t} \\
    y_{2,t} &= c_2 + \phi_{21} y_{1,t-1} + \phi_{22} y_{2,t-1} + \varepsilon_{2,t} \\
    \end{alignat*}
- Intuition:
  - Capture dynamic interrelationships among multiple series
- Used for:
  - Economic indicators
  - Multichannel sensor data
- Example: modeling GDP growth and inflation jointly

* Forecasting with Exogenous Variables
- ARIMAX, VARX, DeepAR architectures
  - ARIMAX (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous variables)
    is an extension of ARIMA that includes external variables
  - VARX (Vector AutoRegression with Exogenous variables) is used for
    multivariate time series data with external influences
  - DeepAR is a deep learning-based approach that can handle exogenous
    variables for probabilistic forecasting
- Incorporating covariates
  - Covariates are external factors that can influence the variable being
    forecasted
  - Common covariates include:
    - Weather conditions (e.g., temperature, precipitation)
    - Holidays and special events (e.g., Christmas, Black Friday)
    - Marketing events (e.g., promotions, advertising campaigns)
- Applications
  - Retail forecasting
    - Predicting sales based on upcoming holidays or promotional events
    - E.g., forecasting increased demand for winter clothing based on weather
      forecasts
  - Energy consumption
    - Estimating future energy needs based on temperature changes or public
      holidays
    - E.g., predicting higher electricity usage during a heatwave

# Modern Approaches

* State Space Models

- State space models describes how a system evolves over time using states and
  observations

- **Components**
  - State vector $x_t$: Hidden/internal state of the system at time $t$
  - Observation vector $y_t$: What we can measure at time $t$
  - The model is
    \begin{alignat*}{2}
    & x_{t+1} = F_t x_t + G_t u_t + w_t (\text{ State equation}) \\
    & y_t = H_t x_t + v_t (\text{ Observation equation}) \\
    \end{alignat*}
    where:
    - $F_t$: State transition matrix
    - $G_t$: Control input matrix
    - $H_t$: Observation matrix
    - $w_t$, $v_t$: Process and observation noise

- **Goal**
  - Infer hidden states from noisy observations
  - Predict future observations or states

- **Applications**
  - Engineering: control systems, signal processing
  - Economics: modeling time series data
  - Robotics: tracking position and velocity

- **Common Algorithms**
  - Kalman Filter (linear, Gaussian)
  - Extended/Unscented Kalman Filter (nonlinear)
  - Particle Filter (nonlinear, non-Gaussian)

* Frequency Domain Methods
- Analyze time series in terms of cycles and frequencies
  - E.g., Fourier Transform decomposes series into sinusoidal components
- Intuition:
  - Understand repeating patterns that may not be obvious in time domain
- Useful for:
  - Identifying dominant periodicities
  - Filtering noise
- Applications:
  - Seismology
  - Climate cycles
- Example: detect yearly cycle in temperature data

* Machine Learning for Time Series
- Use supervised learning to predict future values
- Feature engineering, e.g.,
  - Lags
  - Rolling values
  - Fourier terms
- Common algorithms:
  - Decision trees
  - Random forests
  - Gradient boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
- Pros
  - Handle nonlinearity and complex interactions
- Cons
  - Often requires careful cross-validation due to temporal structure

- Example: predicting electricity consumption using lagged features

* Deep Learning for Time Series
- Specialized neural networks for sequential data
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):
    - Capture dependencies across time steps
  - Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs):
    - Solve vanishing gradient problem
    - Retain long-term dependencies
  - Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs):
    - Use causal convolutions for sequence modeling
- Pros:
  - Handle complex, nonlinear dynamics
- Cons:
  - Require large datasets and careful tuning
- Example: predicting stock price movements using past sequences

* Bayesian Time Series Models

- Incorporate prior beliefs and uncertainty into time series modeling
  - **Bayesian ARIMA**:
    - Extends classical ARIMA with prior distributions on parameters
    - Captures uncertainty in predictions and parameter estimates

  - **Bayesian State Space Models**:
    - General framework for modeling hidden processes over time
    - Includes Kalman Filters and extensions with Bayesian inference

- Solve with MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo):
  - Key method for posterior inference in Bayesian models
  - Generates samples from complex posterior distributions
  - Probabilistic programming tools, e.g., PyMC

- Pros
  - Enables rich, interpretable models with quantified uncertainty
  - Suitable for forecasting, anomaly detection, and causal inference

- Cons
  - Computationally expensive

# Special techniques for time series modeling

* Time Series Machine Learning: Problems

- **Time Dependence**
  - Observations are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
  - Temporal ordering affects model assumptions and evaluation
  - Past values can strongly influence future ones (autocorrelation)

- **Non-Stationarity**
  - Data distributions change over time (mean, variance, etc.)
  - Models trained on past data may perform poorly on future data

- **Data Leakage**
  - Using future information in training can lead to over-optimistic results
  - Requires careful data splitting (e.g., no random shuffling)

- **Seasonality and Trends**
  - Regular patterns (e.g., daily, yearly) complicate modeling
  - Need to be explicitly handled or removed

- **Missing or Irregular Data**
  - Time series often have missing timestamps or irregular intervals

- **Evaluation Challenges**
  - Time-aware cross-validation needed (e.g., rolling windows)

- **Feature Engineering Complexity**
  - Lagged variables, rolling statistics, and domain-specific features needed
  - Makes pipeline design more involved compared to i.i.d. data

* Cross-Validation for Time Series
- Standard cross-validation is not suitable due to time dependency

- **Walk-forward validation** is a time-aware cross-validation method for time
  series data
  - Mimics real-world usage: train on past, predict future
  - Choose a fixed-size training window
  - Move the training and testing windows forward in time step-by-step
  - Train and evaluate model performance at each step

- **Example**:
  - Step 1: Train on $[t_1, t_{100}]$, test on $t_{101}$
  - Step 2: Train on $[t_2, t_{101}]$, test on $t_{102}$
  - Continue moving forward through the time series

- **Pros**:
  - Preserves time order
  - Provides multiple performance estimates across time

- **Cons**
  - Machine learning becomes even more complicated
  - Conflates generalization error and non-stationarity

* Anomaly Detection in Time Series
- Identify unusual patterns not consistent with past behavior
  - Important to account for seasonality and trend
  - Unsupervised methods are often necessary
- Common methods:
  - Statistical thresholds
    - Gaussian modeling and consider anomaly anything $> 3\sigma$ from mean
  - Machine learning, e.g.,
    - Trees
    - Autoencoders
- Applications:
  - Finance: fraud detection, unusual trading activity
  - Cybersecurity: intrusion detection, system failures
  - Example: detecting a sudden drop in website traffic

* Probabilistic Forecasting
- Predict full distribution of future values, not just a single number
  - Useful when risk-sensitive decisions depend on forecast range
  - Helps express uncertainty explicitly
  - E.g., forecasting a 90% prediction interval for electricity demand
  - E.g., finance, weather forecasting, and supply chain management

- Common methods:
  - Quantile regression
    - Predict specific quantiles (e.g., 10%, 50%, 90%)
    - E.g., estimating the 10th percentile of future stock prices to assess
      downside risk
  - Bayesian models
    - Incorporate prior knowledge and update beliefs with new data
    - E.g., using Bayesian models to update demand forecasts as new sales data
      becomes available
  - Other methods:
    - Bootstrapping techniques to generate prediction intervals
    - Ensemble methods that combine multiple models to improve forecast
      accuracy

* Granger Causality
- A statistical hypothesis test for determining causality in time series
  - Variable $X$ _Granger-causes_ $Y$ if past values of $X$ contain information
    that helps predict $Y$ beyond the past values of $Y$ alone
  - E.g., fit two Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models:
    - Restricted model: only past $Y$
    - Unrestricted model: past $Y$ and past $X$
    - Test null hypothesis: $X$ does not Granger-cause $Y$

- Cons:
  - Predictive, not necessarily true causal influence
  - Based on temporal precedence and improvement in forecast
  - Need to measure out-of-sample 
  - Need to account for model complexity
  - Sensitive to model specification (e.g., lag choice and non-linearity)

- Applications:
  - Macroeconomics: does money supply affect inflation?
  - Finance: does trading volume predict stock returns?
  - Neuroscience: do neural signals in one region predict another?

* Change Point Detection in Time Series
- Identify times when the statistical properties of a time series change, e.g.,
  - Mean shift
  - Variance change
  - Trend change
  - Distribution change

- **Methods**
  - Offline detection: analyze full data set
    - Useful when historical data is available
    - E.g., analyzing stock prices over the past year to detect shifts
  - Online detection: identify change in real-time
    - Crucial for applications requiring immediate response
    - E.g., monitoring network traffic for anomalies

- **Approaches**
  - Model-based methods rely on assumptions about data distribution
    - E.g., ARIMA models for time series forecasting
  - Bayesian approaches:
    - Model changes with probabilistic assumptions and priors

- **Applications**
  - Financial market regime shifts
    - Detecting bull and bear markets
  - Environmental change
    - Monitoring climate data for significant shifts
  - System anomalies
    - Identifying unusual patterns in server logs or network traffic

* Markov-Switching Models

- Time series models that allow regime changes over time
  - Data is generated by multiple underlying regimes (states)
  - Regimes switch according to a Markov process
  - Each regime
    - Has its own parameters (e.g., mean, variance, AR coefficients)
    - Can represent different behaviors (e.g., growth vs. recession)

- **Markov Property**:
  - Probability of switching depends only on the current state
  - Defined by a state transition matrix

- **Applications**:
  - Economics: modeling business cycles
  - Finance: volatility modeling (e.g., bull vs. bear markets)

- Pros:
  - Captures nonlinear dynamics and structural breaks in time series
